The code on a noninstitutional claim indicating to whom payment was made or if the claim was denied.

NOTE1: Effective with Version 'J', the field has been expanded on the NCH record to 2 bytes, With this expansion, the NCH will no longer use the character values to represent the official two byte values sent in by CWF since 4/2002. During the Version J conversion, all character values were converted to the two byte values.

NOTE2: Effective 4/1/02, this field was expanded to two bytes to accommodate new values. The NCH Nearline file did not expand the current 1-byte field but instituted a crosswalk of the 2-byte field to the 1-byte character value. See table of code for the crosswalk.

The national provider identifier (NPI) number of the physician who referred the beneficiary to the physician who performed the Part B services.

NOTE: Effective May 2007, the NPI will be- come the national standard identifier for covered health care providers. NPIs will replace current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identification numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).

NOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available on the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to re- ceive any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no new UPINs (legacy number) will be generated for new physicians (Part B and Outpatient claims) so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.

On an institutional claim, the national provider identifier (NPI) number assigned to uniquely identify the physician who has overall responsibility for the beneficiary's care and treatment.

NOTE: Effective May 2007, the NPI will be- come the national standard identifier for covered health care providers. NPIs will replace current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identification numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).

NOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy number) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and Outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.

	DESCRIPTION :
	DESCRIPTION:
	Missing present on admission (POA) indicators on the NCH claims.
	BACKGROUND :
	A problem has been discovered with the Inpatient claims received
	from CWF from July 6, 2009 through October 4, 2009. The
	claims received during this timeperiod have no POA indicators.
	The problem was a result of a defect in the conversion code
	used by CWF to convert the new 5010 record format back to the
	4010 format for the NCH. The reason CWF was converting the
	claims to the 4010 format was because they implemented the 5010
	format beginning in July 2009 but the NCH is still using
	the 4010 until 1/3/2011.
	CORRECTIVE ACTION:
	CWF will be sending in adjustment claims to correct the
	problem. The claims will come into the NCH the week of
	December 19, 2009. There were approximately 3 million
	claims missing the POA indicator.CLM_POA_IND_CD_LIM

This variable is the standard payment amount for long-term care hospitals (LTCH) under the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS), which is based on the MS-LTC-DRG.    

This amount does not include any applicable outlier payment amount.

Applies only to Inpatient (LTCH) claims.  This field is new in October 2015. For a LTCH PPS claim, only one of four fields will be populated (CLM_SITE_NTRL_PYMT_CST_AMT, CLM_SITE_NTRL_PYMT_IPPS_AMT, CLM_FULL_STD_PYMT_AMT, or CLM_SS_OUTLIER_STD_PYMT_AMT) as they are mutually exclusive (i.e., only one of the 4 fields will have a non-zero value). The field with the non-zero value is included in the Claim Payment Amount field.

## [Claim HHA Care Start Date](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/Claim-HHA-Care-Start-Date)

- Short SAS Name: `HHSTRTDT`
- Long SAS Name: `CLM_ADMSN_DT`

Contained in

- [Home Health Agency RIF](../hha-rif.md#data-documentation)

Effective with Version H, the date care started for the HHA services reported on the institutional claim with a from date greater than 3/31/98. The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) required that this field be present on all HHA claims.

NOTE1: Beginning with NCH weekly process date 4/3/98, this field was populated with data. Claims processed prior to 4/3/98 will contain zeroes in this field.

NOTE2: Effective with Version 'I', the start of care date will be moved from the 1st eight positions of the Claim Treatment Authorization Number. Prior to Version 'I' this date was moved from Occurrence Code 27 date field.

Data Variable Alert: The Claim HHA Care Start Date variable (CLM_ADMSN_DT) is often missing in the 2011-2012 claims. CMS has since corrected the issue for 2013 onward. However, CMS has no plans to fix the 2011-2012 claims.

Effective with Version H, the count of the number of HHA visits as derived by CWF.

NOTE1: During the Version H conversion this field was populated with data throughout history (back to service year 1991) using the CWF derivation rule (units associated with revenue center codes 042X, 043X, 044X, 055X, 056X, 057X, 058X and 059X. Value `999` will be displayed if the sum of the revenue center unit count equals or exceeds `999`.

NOTE2: Effective 7/1/99, all HHA claims received with service from dates 7/1/99 and after will be processed as if the units field contains the 15 minute interval count; and each visit revenue code line item will be counted as ONE visit. This field is calculated correctly; but those users who derive the count themselves they will have to revise their routine. NO LONGER IS THE COUNT DERIVED BY ADDING UP THE UNITS FIELDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HHA VISIT REVENUE CODES.

 Under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction (HRR) Program, the amount used to identify the readmission adjustment factor that will be applied.

The ACA (Section 3025) requires CMS to reduce payments to subsection (d) Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospitals with excess readmissions. There is a variable that indicates whether the hospital was excluded from the HRR program (see CLM_HRR_PRTCPNT_IND_CD). This percentage reduction is applied to the base operating DRG amount(defined as the wage-adjusted DRG payment plus new technology add-on payments). 

Additional information is available on the CMS "Hospital Value-Based Purchasing" website. 

The actual dollar amount of the adjustment that applied to the claim is found in the variable called CLM_HRR_ADJSTMT_PMT_AMT.    

This initiative began in 4th Quarter of 2012 (i.e., beginning of Federal fiscal year 13).   

This field was new in 2012, and is null/missing for all previous years.

A switch indicating whether or not a Managed Care Organization (MCO) has paid the provider for an institutional claim.

??? limitation
	DESCRIPTION :
	The MCO paid switch made consistent with criteria used to identify an inpatient encounter claim.
	
	BACKGROUND :
	During the NCH Version 'I' conversion, history was populated with an NCH Claim Type Code that will identify the record as an inpatient encounter claim.
	When applying the CWF logic to identify an inpatient encounter claim, it was discovered that when all the criteria was met the MCO paid switch was sometimes a blank or '0' (reflecting that the MCO did not pay the provider).
	
	CORRECTIVE ACTION :
	With the inception of the Version 'I' processing (7/00), if all the criteria for identifying an inpatient encounter claim is met but the MCO paid switch is a blank or '0' it is changed to a '1'. A patch code = '13' was applied to all claims back to 7/1/97 service year thru date.

The reason that no Medicare payment is made for services on an institutional claim.

NOTE1: This field was put on all institutional claim types but data did not start coming in on OP/HHA/Hospice until 4/1/02. Prior to 4/1/02, data only came in Inpatient/SNF claims.

NOTE2: Effective 4/1/02, this field was also expanded to two bytes to accommodate new values. The NCH Nearline file did not expand the current 1-byte field but instituted a crosswalk of the 2-byte field to the 1-byte character value. See table of code for the crosswalk.

NOTE3: Effective with Version 'J', the field has been expanded on the NCH claim to 2 bytes. With this expansion the NCH will no longer use the character values to represent the official two byte values being sent in by CWF since 4/2002.

During the Version 'J' conversion, all character values were converted to the two byte values.

NOTE4: These code values were not identified as part of the original CMS data documentation.  ResDAC has identified the values and has provided them for convenience.

Effective 4/1/02, the Medicare nonpayment reason code was expanded to a 2-byte field.  The NCH instituted a crosswalk from the 2-byte code to a 1-byte character code. Below are the character codes (found in NCH & NMUD). At some point, NMUD will carry the 2-byte code but NCH will continue to have the 1-byte character code.

This field identifies the method of payment of a claim billed within 30 days of a Model 4 Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) admission.

Bundling payment for services that patients receive across a single episode of care, such as heart bypass surgery or a hip replacement, is one way to encourage doctors, hospitals and other health care providers to work together to better coordinate care for patients. Under the Model 4 BPCI pilot, CMS will reimburse qualified acute care hospitals a blended payment for hospital inpatient care and physician services connected with a single episode of care. This will occur in association with inpatient hospital claims that the BPCI participating hospital will bill to their jurisdictional A/B MAC as type of bill 11X claims.

On an institutional claim, the National Provider Identifier (NPI) number assigned to uniquely identify the physician with the primary responsibility for performing the surgical procedure(s).

NOTE: Effective May 2007, the NPI will become the national standard identifier for covered health care providers. NPIs will replace the current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identi- fication numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).

NOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy number and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system maint- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when its adjudicated. We will continue to re- ceive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy numbers) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.

On an institutional claim, the National Provider Identifier (NPI) number assigned to uniquely identify the other physician associated with the institutiohal claim.

NOTE: Effective May 2007, the NPI will be- come the national standard identifier for covered health care providers. NPIs will replace current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identification numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).

NOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy number) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B AND outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.

The code used to identify the CMS specialty code corresponding to the other physician. 

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides for incentive payments for physicians and non-physician practitioners with specific primary specialty designations. In order to determine if the physician or non-physician is eligible for the incentive payment, the specialty code, NPI and name must be carried on the claims.

	DESCRIPTION :
	Field erroneously blanked out on segments 2-10.
	BACKGROUND :
	During the Version 'I' conversion of all service years
	(1991-6/30/00) the following field was erroneously
	blanked out on segments 2-10.During the Version 'I' planning process, it was decided
	that all codes, dates, numbers, names and percent fields
	would be populated on all segments of a claim; but
	amount, counts, and quantities would be zeroed out on
	segments 2-10 to eliminate the risk of overstating values.
	CORRECTIVE ACTION :
	This data can not be recovered.

Amount of payment made from the Medicare trust fund for the services covered by the claim record. Generally, the amount is calculated by the FI or carrier; and represents what was paid to the institutional provider, physician, or supplier, with the exceptions noted below. **NOTE: In some situations, a negative claim payment amount may be pre- sent; e.g., (1) when a beneficiary is charged the full deductible during a short stay and the deductible exceeded the amount Medicare pays; or (2) when a beneficiary is charged a coinsurance amount during a long stay and the coinsurance amount exceeds the amount Medicare pays (most prevalent situation involves psych hospitals who are paid a daily per diem rate no matter what the charges are.)

Under IP PPS, inpatient hospital services are paid based on a predetermined rate per discharge, using the DRG patient classification system and the PRICER program. On the IP PPS claim, the payment amount includes the DRG outlier approved payment amount, disproportionate share (since 5/1/86), indirect medical education (since 10/1/88), total PPS capital (since 10/1/91). After 4/1/03, the payment amount could also include a "new technology" add-on amount. It does NOT include the pass-thru amounts (i.e., capital- related costs, direct medical education costs, kidney acquisition costs, bad debts); or any beneficiary-paid amounts (i.e., deductibles and coinsurance); or any any other payer reimbursement.

Under IRFPPS, inpatient rehabilitation services are paid based on a predetermined rate per discharge, using the Case Mix Group (CMG) classification system and the PRICER program. From the CMG on the IRF PPS claim, payment is based on a standard payment amount for operating and capital cost for that facility (including routine and ancillary services). The payment is adjusted for wage, the % of low-income patients (LIP), locality, transfers, interrupted stays, short stay cases, deaths, and high cost outliers. Some or all of these adjustments could apply. The CMG payment does NOT include certain pass- through costs (i.e. bad debts, approved education activities); beneficiary-paid amounts, other payer reim- bursement,and other services outside of the scope of PPS.

Under LTCH PPS, long term care hospital services are paid based on a predetermined rate per discharge based on the DRG and the PRICER program. Payments are based on a single standard Federal rate for both inpatient operating and capital-related costs (including routine and ancillary services), but do NOT include certain pass-through costs (i.e. bad debts, direct medical education, new technologies and blood clotting factors). Adjustments to the payment may occur due to short-stay outliers, interrupted stays, high cost outliers, wage index, and cost of living adjust- ments.

Under SNF PPS, SNFs will classify beneficiaries using the patient classification system known as RUGS III. For the SNF PPS claim, the SNF PRICER will calculate/return the rate for each revenue center line item with revenue center code = `0022`; multiply the rate times the units count; and then sum the amount payable for all lines with revenue center code `0022` to determine the total claim payment amount.

Under Outpatient PPS, the national ambulatory payment classification (APC) rate that is calculated for each APC group is the basis for determining the total claim payment. The payment amount also includes the outlier payment and interest.

Under Home Health PPS, beneficiaries will be classified into an appropriate case mix category known as the Home Health Resource Group. A HIPPS code is then generated corresponding to the case mix category (HHRG).

For the RAP, the PRICER will determine the payment amount appropriate to the HIPPS code by computing 60% (for first episode) or 50% (for subsequent episodes) of the case mix episode payment. The payment is then wage index adjusted.

For the final claim, PRICER calculates 100% of the amount due, because the final claim is processed as an adjustment to the RAP, reversing the RAP payment in full. Although final claim will show 100% payment amount, the provider will actually receive the 40% or 50% payment. The payment may also include outlier payments.

Exceptions: For claims involving demos and BBA encounter data, the amount reported in this field may not just represent the actual provider payment.

For demo Ids `01`,`02`,`03`,`04` -- claims contain amount paid to the provider, except that special 'differentials' paid outside the normal payment system are not included.

For demo Ids `05`,`15` -- encounter data 'claims' contain amount Medicare would have paid under FFS, instead of the actual payment to the MCO.

For demo Ids `06`,`07`,`08` -- claims contain actual provider payment but represent a special negotiated bundled payment for both Part A and Part B services. To identify what the conventional provider Part A payment would have been, check value code = `Y4`. The related noninstitutional (physician/supplier) claims contain what would have been paid had there been no demo.

For BBA encounter data (non-demo) -- 'claims' contain amount Medicare would have paid under FFS, instead of the actual payment to the BBA plan.

This variable is the National Provider Identifier (NPI) for the physician who rendered the services. NPIs replaced UPINs as the standard provider identifiers beginning in 2007. The UPIN is almost never populated after 2009. 

CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system maintainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no new UPINs (legacy numbers) will be generated for new physicians (Part B and outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.

Effective with Version G, the total charges for all services included on the institutional claim. This field is redundant with revenue center code 0001/total charges.

??? limitation
	DESCRIPTION :
	The total charge amount field in the fixed portion was
	truncated on outpatient, hospice and home health claims.
	BACKGROUND :
	For outpatient, hospice and home health claims, the
	total charge amount field in the fixed portion was
	truncated (the cents were dropped off; the decimal
	point was moved, making cents out of dollars) in the
	CWFMQA process beginning with data received from CWF
	1/4/99 through 5/14/99. The problem occurred when
	CWF increased the size of the field.
	CORRECTIVE ACTION :
	The CWFMQA front-end was fixed. The Nearline was patched during the quarterly merge in 7/99 for service years 1998 and 1999. The NCH_PACTCH_CD field will be populated with a value '11'. The 1998 and 1999 SAFs were corrected when finalized in 7/99. The patch involved moving the total charge amount in the revenue center trailer to the total charge amount field in the fixed portion, for records with NCH Daily Process Date 1/4/99 - 5/14/99.

This initiative began in 4th Quarter of 2013 (i.e., beginning of Federal fiscal year 14 [FY14]).   

This field was new in 2013, and is null/missing for all previous years. The HVBP applies only to subsection (d) IPPS hospitals. There is a variable that indicates whether the hospital was excluded from HVBP (see CLM_VBP_PRTCPNT_IND_CD). This percentage reduction is applied  to the base operating DRG amount, depending on their TPS (which is the Value Based Purchasing Score), as required by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The percentages change each FY.  

Additional information is available on the CMS "Hospital Value-Based Purchasing" website. 

The actual dollar amount of the adjustment that applied to the claim is found in the variable called CLM_VBP_ADJSTMT_PMT_AMT.

The National Provider Identifier (NPI) assigned to the supplier of the Part B service/DMEPOS line item.

NOTE: Effective May 2007, the NPI will become the national standard identifier for covered health care providers. NPIs will replace the current legacy provider numbers (UPINs, PINs, OSCAR provider numbers, etc.) on the standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capa- bility was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, NPIs OSCAR provider numbers, etc.).

NOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (legacy numbers and NPIs) must be available on the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system maintainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and Outpatient claims) so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those phy- sicians.

The unique CCW indentifier for a beneficiary. The CCW assigns a unique beneficiary identification number to each individual who receives Medicare and/or Medicaid, and uses that number to identify an individual’s records in all CCW data files (e.g., Medicare claims, MAX claims, MDS assessment data). This number does not change during a beneficiary’s lifetime and each number is used only once. The BENE_ID is specific to the CCW and is not applicable to any other identification system or data source.

## [Endometrial Cancer End-of-Year Flag](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/Endometrial-Cancer-End-Year-Flag)

- Short SAS Name: `CNCRENDM`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

This variable indicates whether a beneficiary met the chronic condition data warehouse (CCW) criteria for endometrial cancer as of the end of the calendar year.



<h3>Values</h3>

The CCW’s chronic condition flags require beneficiaries to satisfy both claims criteria (a minimum number/type of claims that have the proper diagnosis codes and occurred within a specified time period) and coverage criteria (FFS Part A and Part B coverage during the entire specified time period). For endometrial cancer, beneficiaries must have at least one inpatient or SNF claim, or two Part B (institutional or non-institutional) claims that are at least one day apart, with an endometrial cancer code in any position during the 1-year reference period. The CCW’s criteria were developed after reviewing validated algorithms from the research literature and criteria used by other federal data sources.  You can find more detailed information on the criteria on the CCW website: https://www.ccwdata.org/web/guest/condition-categories


| Code   | Code Value                      |

## [Enhanced Medicare 5% Sample Indicator](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/Enhanced-5-Flag)

- Short SAS Name: `EFIVEPCT`
- Long SAS Name: `ENHANCED_FIVE_PERCENT_FLAG`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

This variable indicates whether the beneficiary was ever included in the CCW 5% sample for any year (1999+).

This enhanced 5% sample is broader than the annual 5% sample (variable that was previously called FIVE_PERCENT_FLAG; currently called SAMPLE_GROUP - when value =`01` or `04`) because it includes all beneficiaries who were ever part of the 5% sample but had a HIC change that was not part of the sample. The "enhanced" indicator variable allows for longitudinal study of the 5% sample (i.e., once in, always in).
CCW creates the 5% sample using standard CMS processes. The 5% random sample consists of people who had a Medicare beneficiary Health Insurance Claim number (HIC) equal to the Claim Account Number (CAN) plus Beneficiary Identity Code (BIC) (HIC=CAN+BIC) where the last two digits of the CAN are in the set {05, 20, 45, 70, 95}.



<h3>Values</h3>

| Code   | Code Value                          |
|:-------|:------------------------------------|
| Y      | Yes, included in enhanced 5% sample |
| nan    | Not included in enhanced 5% sample  |

- Short SAS Name: `EPILEP_MEDICARE`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

This variable indicates whether a beneficiary met the condition criteria for epilepsy as of the end of the calendar year.

NOTE: The condition variable requires beneficiaries to satisfy both claims criteria (a minimum number/type of Medicare claims that have the proper diagnosis codes and occurred within a specified time period) and coverage criteria (Medicare FFS Part A and Part B coverage during the entire specified time period).

NOTE1: For epilepsy, beneficiaries must have at least one Medicare inpatient claim or two other non-drug claims of any service type with a related code in any position during the 2-year reference period. You can find more detailed information on the criteria on the CCW website: https://www.ccwdata.org/web/guest/condition-categories

- Short SAS Name: `EPILEP_MEDICARE_EVER`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

This variable shows the date when the beneficiary first met the criteria for the epilepsy indicator. The variable will be blank for beneficiaries that have never had the condition.

NOTE: The earliest possible date for anyone in the CCW is January 1, 1999. If the beneficiary became eligible for Medicare after that, the earliest possible date will be some time after his/her coverage start date (i.e., the COVSTART variable in the Beneficiary File).



## [Equated BIC](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/Equated-BIC)

- Short SAS Name: `EQ_BIC`

Contained in

- [MedPAR RIF](../medpar-rif.md#data-documentation)

The code categorizing groups of BICs representing similar relationships between the beneficiary and primary wage earner.

NOTE: The equatable BIC module electronically matches two records that contain different BICs where it is apparent both are records for the same beneficiary. It validates the BIC and returns a base BIC under which to house the record in the National Claims History (NCH) databases. (All records for a beneficiary are stored under a single BIC).

This variable indicates whether a beneficiary met the condition criteria for fibromyalgia, chronic pain and fatigue as of the end of the calendar year.

NOTE: The condition variable requires beneficiaries to satisfy both claims criteria (a minimum number/type of Medicare claims that have the proper diagnosis codes and occurred within a specified time period) and coverage criteria (Medicare FFS Part A and Part B coverage during the entire specified time period).

NOTE1: For fibromyalgia, chronic pain and fatigue, beneficiaries must have at least one Medicare inpatient claim or two other non-drug claims of any service type with a related code in any position during the 2-year reference period. You can find more detailed information on the criteria on the CCW website: https://www.ccwdata.org/web/guest/condition-categories

The Health Care Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) is a collection of codes that represent procedures, supplies, products and services which may be provided to Medicare beneficiaries and to individuals enrolled in private health insurance programs. The codes are divided into three levels, or groups as described below.

In the Institutional Claim Revenue Center Files, this variable can indicate the specific case-mix grouping that Medicare used to pay for skilled nursing facility (SNF), home health, or inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) services (see Note 2 below).

Level I

Codes and descriptors copyrighted by the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition (CPT-4). These are 5-position numeric codes representing physician and non-physician services.

**** Note 1: **** CPT-4 codes including both long and short descriptions shall be used in accordance with the CMS/AMA agreement. Any other use violates the AMA copyright.

Level II

Includes codes and descriptors copyrighted by the American Dental Association's Current Dental Terminology, Fifth Edition (CDT-5). These are 5-position alpha-numeric codes comprising the D series. All other level II codes and descriptors are approved and maintained jointly by the alpha- numeric editorial panel (consisting of CMS, the Health Insurance Association of America, and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association). These are 5-position alpha-numeric codes representing primarily items and non-physician services that are not represented in the level I codes.

Level III

Codes and descriptors developed by Medicare carriers (currently known as Medicare Administrative Contractors; MACs) for use at the local (MAC) level. These are 5-position alpha-numeric codes in the W, X, Y or Z series representing physician and non-physician services that are not represented in the level I or level II codes.

**** Note 2: ****

This field may contain information regarding case-mix grouping that Medicare used to pay for SNF, home health, or IRF services. These groupings are sometimes known as Health Insurance Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) codes. This field will contain a HIPPS code if the revenue center code (REV_CNTR) equals 0022 for SNF care, 0023 for home health, or 0024 for IRF care. For home health claims, please also see the revenue center APC/HIPPS code variable (REV_CNTR_APC_HIPPS_CD).

Contained in

- [MedPAR RIF](../medpar-rif.md#data-documentation)

The count of the number of days from the date the beneficiary was admitted to a facility to the beneficiary's date of death (DOD).

??? derivation
	This field is derived by counting the number of days between the MEDPAR admission date (the admission date present on the first claim record included in the stay) and MEDPAR beneficiary death date (the death date present on the enrollment database, which is accessed prior to creation of the quarterly MEDPAR file).

??? limitation
	DESCRIPTION :
	MEDPAR Admission Death Day Count calculated incorrectly, on both the 3/00 and 6/00 MEDPAR updates.
	BACKGROUND :
	Both the 3/00 and 6/00 MEDPAR updates incorrectly calculated the mortality days; i.e., days between the admission date and the beneficiary date of death. Users of the regular unencrypted MEDPAR file, this is not a problem, as the count can be calculated using the admission date and the date of death.  The problem is with the encrypted file (the expanded modified MEDPAR) because the fields needed to calculate the mortality days are ranged.
	CORRECTIVE ACTION :
	The problem was corrected with the 12/00 MEDPAR update.  NOTE:  For users of the expanded modified MEDPAR file who needs the mortality days, the 12/00 update of the FY1999 file can be given as a replacement.

- [MedPAR RIF](../medpar-rif.md#data-documentation)

The amount of money (rounded to whole dollars) identified as the beneficiary's liability for the blood deductible for the stay.

??? derivation
	This field is derived by accumulating the beneficiary blood deductible liability amount that is present on any of the claim records included in the stay (i.e., the sum of the blood deductibles reported on the claims that comprise the stay).

??? limitation
	DESCRIPTION :
	It was discovered that the blood deductible amounts were incorrect on the Old MEDPAR Files.
	BACKGROUND    :
	Users of the MEDPAR data were comparing money amounts and counts present on the new MEDPAR file (created 6/95 using NCH Nearline File as the source) to that reported on the old MEDPAR File (created 3/95 and prior from claims from the Medicare Quality Assurance System) for Fiscal Year 1994.  They discovered that the blood deductible amount on the new MEDPAR was greater than that of the old MEDPAR.
	
	During NCH's investigation it was determined that the old 500-character MEDPAR incorrectly used a different field to report the blood deductible; specifically the noncovered
	charges derived from blood use Revenue Center codes 0380-0389.  The new program correctly used the NCH field, BENE_BLOOD_DDCTBL_LBLTY_AMT, which is derived from a value code (CLM_VAL_AMT associated with CLM_VAL_CD = '6').
	
	It is believed that all MEDPAR files created prior to 6/95 in the 500 character version are affected. MEDPAR 500 was first available with calendar year and fiscal year 9/91 updates for year 1987 forward.
	
	NOTE:  This anamoly also impacts the DRG Price Amount on the old MEDPAR file because it is calculated from a number of fields including the blood deductible.

## [MEDPAR Beneficiary Death Date](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/MEDPAR-Beneficiary-Death-Date)

- Short SAS Name: `DEATHDT`

Contained in

- [MedPAR RIF](../medpar-rif.md#data-documentation)

The date the beneficiary died.

??? derivation
	This field comes from the beneficiary death date, if present on the enrollment database, which is accessed prior to creation of the quarterly MEDPAR file.

??? limitation
	  DESCRIPTION :
	The Date of Death on the MEDPAR files were not up-to-date for four cycles.
	BACKGROUND  :
	 The MEDPAR process pulls in 10 segments of the HISKEW file, to get the date of death.  The HISKEW file names were changed with no notification the change was being made.  Because of this, MEDPAR kept using the HISKEW that was created in June 2000.
	The incomplete MEDPAR cycles are: 12/2000, 3/2001,  6/2001 and 9/2001 (9/2000 MEDPAR was not run).
	CORRECTIVE ACTION :
	Since this anamoly causes no major problem to the prime user of this data, a rerun will not take place.
	NOTE:  The 12/01 quarterly update will access up-to-date information.

The amount (called the 'DRG price' for purposes of MEDPAR analysis) that would have been paid if no deductibles, coinsurance, primary payers, or outliers were involved (rounded to whole dollars).

??? derivation
	This field is derived by accumulating the following amounts: MEDPAR Medicare payment amount, MEDPAR beneficiary primary payer payment amount, MEDPAR beneficiary coinsurance liability amount, MEDPAR beneficiary Inpatient deductible liability amount, MEDPAR beneficiary blood deductible amount; and then subtracting from the sum the MEDPAR DRG outlier approved payment amount.

??? limitation
	DESCRIPTION :
	IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE DRG PRICE AMOUNT WSA INCORRECT ON THE OLD MEDPAR FILES.
	BACKGROUND  :
	Users of the MEDPAR data were comparing money amounts and counts present on the new MEDPAR file (created 6/95 using NCH Nearline File as the source) to that reported on the old MEDPAR File (created 3/95 and prior from claims from the Medicare Quality Assurance System) for Fiscal Year 1994.  They discovered that the DRG price amount on the new MEDPAR contained incorrect amounts.
	
	NOTE:  This anamoly occurs because the DRG price amount is calculated from a number of fields including the blood deductible amount, which was discovered to be populated incorrectly.
	
	During NCH's investigation it was determined that the old 500-character MEDPAR incorrectly used a different field to report the blood deductible; specifically the noncovered charges derived from blood use Revenue Center codes 0380-0389.  The new program correctly used the NCH field, BENE_BLOOD_DDCTBL_LBLTY_AMT, which is derived from a value code (CLM_VAL_AMT associated with CLM_VAL_CD = '6').
	
	It is believed that all MEDPAR files created prior to 6/95 in the 500 character version were affected. MEDPAR 500 was first available with calendar year and fiscal year 9/91  updates for year 1987 forward.

Amount of payment made from the Medicare trust fund for the services covered by the claim record. Generally, the amount is calculated by the fi; and represents what was paid to the institutional provider, with the exceptions noted below.

NOTE: In some situations, a negative claim payment amount may be present; e.g., (1) when a beneficiary is charged the full deductible during a short stay and the deductible exceeded the amount Medicare pays; or (2) when a beneficiary is charged a coinsurance amount during a long stay and the coinsurance amount exceeds the amount Medicare pays (most prevalent situation involves psych hospitals who are paid a daily per diem rate no matter what the charges are.)

Under IP PPS, Inpatient hospital services are paid based on a predetermined rate per discharge, using the DRG patient classification system and the pricer program. On the IP PPS claim, the payment amount includes the DRG outlier approved payment amount, disproportionate share (since 05/1/86), in- direct medical education (since 10/1/88), total PPS capital (since 10/1/91). It does not include the pass thru amounts (i.e., capital-related costs, direct medical education costs, kidney acquisition costs, bad debts); or any beneficiary-paid amounts (i.e., deductibles and coinsurance); or any other payer reimbursement.

Under SNF PPS, SNFs will classify beneficiaries using the patient classification system known as rugs III. For the SNF PPS claim, the SNF pricer will calculate/return the rate for each revenue center line item with revenue center code = `0022`; multiply the rate times the units count; and then sum the amount payable for all lines with revenue center code `0022` to determine the total claim payment amount.

Exceptions: For claims involving demos and BBA encounter data, the amount reported in this field May not just represent the actual provider payment.

For demo ids `01`,`02`,`03`,`04` -- claims contain amount paid to the provider, except that special 'differentials' paid outside the normal payment system are not included.

For demo ids `05`,`15` -- encounter data 'claims'contain amount Medicare would have paid under FFS, instead of the actual payment to the MCO.

For demo ids `06`,`07`,`08` -- claims contain actual provider payment but represent a special negotiated bundled payment for both part a and part B services. To identify what the conventional provider part a payment would have been, check value code = `y4`.

For BBA encounter data (non-demo) -- 'claims' contain amount Medicare would have paid under FFS, instead of the actual payment to the BBA plan.

	This field is derived by accumulating the payment amount that is present on all of the claim records included in the stay (i.e, the sum of payment (reimbursement) reported on the claims that comprise the stay).

This variable indicates whether the beneficiary was entitled to Part A, Part B, or both for a given month. There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December). The variable also indicates whether the beneficiary’s state of residence paid his/her monthly premium for Part B coverage (and Part A if necessary). State Medicaid programs can pay those premiums for certain dual eligibles; this action is called “buying in” and so this variable is the “buy-in code.”

Contained in

Medicare 1, 5, or 20% strict sample group indicator.

CCW creates the sample values using standard CMS processes to identify the random 1, 5, 15, and 20 percent samples of Medicare beneficiaries.
The sample groups are based on a random 20 percent sample that is split into three mutually exclusive groups of 1 percent, 4 percent, and 15 percent.
To use the 1 percent sample, specify that SAMPLE_GRP equals “01”.
To use the 5 percent sample, specify that SAMPLE_GRP equals “01” or “04”.
To use the 15 percent sample, specify that SAMPLE_GRP equals “15”.
To use the 20 percent sample, specify that SAMPLE_GRP equals “01”, “04”, or “15”.
Beneficiaries are assigned to sample groups each year based on the last two digits of their Medicare Claim Account Numbers (CANs). Since CANs can change over time (e.g., in the case of remarriage), new beneficiaries are becoming eligible for Medicare, and existing beneficiaries are dying, the sample is cross-sectional. There is no guarantee that the exact same beneficiaries are represented in the same sample group from one year to the next (i.e., this is the strict sampling).

This variable indicates whether the beneficiary was eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid in a given month (April).

The original source for this variable is the State Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) files that states submit to CMS. Those files are considered the “gold standard” for identifying dual eligibles because the information in them is used to determine the level of Medicare Part D low-income subsidies. Dual eligibles are often divided into “full duals” and “partial duals” based on the level of Medicaid benefits they receive. CMS generally considers beneficiaries to be full duals if they have values of 02, 04, or 08, and to be partial duals if they have values of 01, 03, 05, or 06. Partial duals sometimes divided into the QMB-only population (01) and all other partial duals (03, 05, or 06). There are

This variable indicates whether the beneficiary was eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid in a given month (August).

The original source for this variable is the State Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) files that states submit to CMS. Those files are considered the “gold standard” for identifying dual eligibles because the information in them is used to determine the level of Medicare Part D low-income subsidies. Dual eligibles are often divided into “full duals” and “partial duals” based on the level of Medicaid benefits they receive. CMS generally considers beneficiaries to be full duals if they have values of 02, 04, or 08, and to be partial duals if they have values of 01, 03, 05, or 06. Partial duals sometimes divided into the QMB-only population (01) and all other partial duals (03, 05, or 06). There are

Additional information regarding various ways to identify dually enrolled populations, refer to a CCW Technical Guidance document entitled: "Options in Determining Dual Eligibles". There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).

This variable indicates whether the beneficiary was eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid in a given month (July).

The original source for this variable is the State Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) files that states submit to CMS. Those files are considered the “gold standard” for identifying dual eligibles because the information in them is used to determine the level of Medicare Part D low-income subsidies. Dual eligibles are often divided into “full duals” and “partial duals” based on the level of Medicaid benefits they receive. CMS generally considers beneficiaries to be full duals if they have values of 02, 04, or 08, and to be partial duals if they have values of 01, 03, 05, or 06. Partial duals sometimes divided into the QMB-only population (01) and all other partial duals (03, 05, or 06). There are

Additional information regarding various ways to identify dually enrolled populations, refer to a CCW Technical Guidance document entitled: "Options in Determining Dual Eligibles". There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).

Those files are considered the “gold standard” for identifying dual eligibles because the information in them is used to determine the level of Medicare Part D low-income subsidies. Dual eligibles are often divided into “full duals” and “partial duals” based on the level of Medicaid benefits they receive. CMS generally considers beneficiaries to be full duals if they have values of 02, 04, or 08, and to be partial duals if they have values of 01, 03, 05, or 06. Partial duals sometimes divided into the QMB-only population (01) and all other partial duals (03, 05, or 06). There are

This variable is the number of months during the year that the beneficiary was dually eligible (i.e., he/she was also eligible for Medicaid benefits).

CCW derived this variable by counting the number of months where the beneficiary had dual eligibility (DUAL_STUS_CD_XX not equal to `00` or '**').
There are different ways to classify dually eligible beneficiaries - in terms of whether he/she is enrolled in full or partial benefits. Additional information regarding various ways to identify dually enrolled populations, refer to a CCW Technical Guidance document entitled: "Options in Determining Dual Eligibles"

- Short SAS Name: `RDS_MO`
- Long SAS Name: `RDS_CVRG_MONS`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

This variable is the number of months during the year that the beneficiary was enrolled in an employer-sponsored prescription drug plan that qualified for Part D’s retiree drug subsidy (RDS). CCW derives this variable by counting the number of months where the beneficiary had retiree drug subsidy.

A month of RDS is when the RDS_IND_XX for the month = Y.
Some employers offer prescription drug plans to their retirees, and Part D pays a subsidy to plans that offer coverage that is equivalent to (or better than) conventional Part D benefits.
CMS does not collect PDEs for beneficiaries that are enrolled in RDS-eligible plans.

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

This variable indicates whether a beneficiary met the condition criteria for muscular dystrophy as of the end of the calendar year.

NOTE: The condition variable requires beneficiaries to satisfy both claims criteria (a minimum number/type of Medicare claims that have the proper diagnosis codes and occurred within a specified time period) and coverage criteria (Medicare FFS Part A and Part B coverage during the entire specified time period).

NOTE1: For muscular dystrophy, beneficiaries must have at least one Medicare inpatient claim or two other non-drug claims of any service type with a related code in any position during the 2-year reference period. You can find more detailed information on the criteria on the CCW website: https://www.ccwdata.org/web/guest/condition-categories

This field is the amount of physician and other professional charges covered under Medicare Part B.

This variable is not populated for Home Health or Hospice claims. This field is used for CMS editing purposes and other internal processes (e.g. if computing interim payments, then these charges are deducted). The source of information for this field for institutional claims is the CLM_VAL_AMT (when the code = 04 or 05, it indicates a professional component charge amount). For Outpatient claims, this information is from the revenue center codes (when the code=096*, 097* or 098*, then the REV_CNTR_TOT_CHRG_AMT indicates a professional component charge amount).

On an institutional claim, the National Provider Identifier (NPI) number assigned to uniquely identify the institutional provider certified by Medicare to provide services to the beneficiary.

NOTE: Effective May 2007, the NPI will be- come the national standard identifier for covered health care providers. NPIs will replace current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identification numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).

NOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implelmentation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy number) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.

## [Part D Beneficiary Payments](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/Part-D-Beneficiary-Payments)

- Short SAS Name: `PTD_BENE_PMT`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

This variable is the dollar amount that the beneficiary paid for all PDEs for a given year, without being reimbursed by a third party.  The amount includes all copayments, coinsurance, deductible, or other patient payment amounts, and comes directly from the source Prescription Drug Events (PDEs).  

The total beneficiary payments are calculated as the sum of three CCW variables: patient pay amount (PTNT_PAY_AMT), other troop amount (OTHER_TROOP_AMT), and patient liability reduction due to other payer amount (PLRO_AMT) for Part D drugs for the relevant PDEs.



<h3>Values</h3>



This amount contributes to a beneficiary's true out-of-pocket (TrOOP) costs, but only if it is for a Part D-covered drug (i.e., spending on non-covered drugs does not count toward the TrOOP amount).

Note that another PDE variable called the low-income cost sharing (LIS) amount (variable name LICS_AMT), indicates the amount paid by Part D low-income subsidy for the PDE. Although this is sometimes considered a beneficiary payment (since it is made on behalf of a beneficiary), we have included the LIS payments in the Part D Medicare Payment amount (see variable called PTD_MDCR_PMT).

The value will be null if the beneficiary was not enrolled in Part D or did not use any Part D drugs during the year.

This variable is the Part D contract number for the beneficiary’s Part D plan for a given month (April). CMS assigns an identifier to each contract that a Part D plan has with CMS.

The first character of the contract ID is a letter that indicates the type of plan (for July 2009 and later, when X is followed by additional numbers/characters, it indicates Part D enrollment; for 2006-2009 the 'X' appeared without any other digits and indicated the beneficiary was not enrolled in Part D).
If the beneficiary did not have a Part D plan for a given month, this variable will have a value of X, N, 0, or *, or be null/missing for that month. If the beneficiary changed plans during the year, the value indicates the final, reconciled contract number. For 2006 - 2012, this variable was always encrypted to comply with CMS privacy rules.
There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).
You need to know both the Part D contract number and plan benefit package (PTD_PBP_ID_XX) in order to identify the specific plan in which a beneficiary was enrolled.

If the beneficiary did not have a Part D plan for a given month, this variable will have a value of X, N, 0, or *, or be null/missing for that month. If the beneficiary changed plans during the year, the value indicates the final, reconciled contract number. For 2006 - 2012, this variable was always encrypted to comply with CMS privacy rules.
There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).
You need to know both the Part D contract number and plan benefit package (PTD_PBP_ID_XX) in order to identify the specific plan in which a beneficiary was enrolled.

## [Part D Contract Number - July](https://www.resdac.org/taxonomy/term/5431)

- Short SAS Name: `PTDCNTRCT07`
- Long SAS Name: `PTD_CNTRCT_ID_07`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

This variable is the Part D contract number for the beneficiary’s Part D plan for a given month (July). CMS assigns an identifier to each contract that a Part D plan has with CMS.

The first character of the contract ID is a letter that indicates the type of plan (for July 2009 and later, when X is followed by additional numbers/characters, it indicates Part D enrollment; for 2006-2009 the 'X' appeared without any other digits and indicated the beneficiary was not enrolled in Part D).
If the beneficiary did not have a Part D plan for a given month, this variable will have a value of X, N, 0, or *, or be null/missing for that month. If the beneficiary changed plans during the year, the value indicates the final, reconciled contract number. For 2006 - 2012, this variable was always encrypted to comply with CMS privacy rules.
There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).
You need to know both the Part D contract number and plan benefit package (PTD_PBP_ID_XX) in order to identify the specific plan in which a beneficiary was enrolled.

If the beneficiary did not have a Part D plan for a given month, this variable will have a value of X, N, 0, or *, or be null/missing for that month. If the beneficiary changed plans during the year, the value indicates the final, reconciled contract number. For 2006 - 2012, this variable was always encrypted to comply with CMS privacy rules.
There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).
You need to know both the Part D contract number and plan benefit package (PTD_PBP_ID_XX) in order to identify the specific plan in which a beneficiary was enrolled.

## [Part D Events](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/Part-D-Events)

- Short SAS Name: `PTD_EVENTS`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

This variable is the count of events for Part D drugs for a given year (i.e., a unique count of the PDE_IDs). An event is a dispensed (filled) drug prescription that appears in the Prescription Drug Event (PDE) file.



<h3>Values</h3>



The value will be null if the beneficiary was not enrolled in Part D or did not use any Part D drugs during the year.

PDEs consist of highly variable days supply of the medication.  We also create a derived variable that counts a standard 30 day supply of a filled Part D prescription (see PTD_FILL_CNT). 



## [Part D Fill Count](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/Part-D-Fill-Count)

- Short SAS Name: `PTD_FILL_CNT`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

Part D prescribing events consist of highly variable days supply of the medication.  This derived variable creates a standard 30 days supply of a filled Part D prescription, and counts this as a “fill”.   The Part D fill count does not indicate the number of different drugs the person is using, only the total months covered by a medication (e.g., if a patient is receiving a full year supply of a medication, whether this occurs in one transaction or 12 monthly transactions, the fill count = 12; if the patient is taking three such medications, the fill count=36).  



<h3>Values</h3>



The value will be null if the beneficiary was not enrolled in Part D or did not use any Part D drugs during the year.

We also calaculate the acutal number of prescription drug fill events for Part D drugs for a given year (i.e., a unique count of the PDE_IDs); see variable PTD_EVENTS.
 



## [Part D Medicare Payments](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/Part-D-Medicare-Payments)

- Short SAS Name: `PTD_MDCR_PMT`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

This variable is the dollar amount that the Part D plan covered for all covered drugs for a given year. The variable is calculated as the sum of the plan payments for covered PDEs (CVRD_D_PLAN_PD_AMT) and the low income cost sharing subsidy amount (LICS_AMT) during the year.



<h3>Values</h3>



This variable does not include all costs to Medicare for the Part D benefit; it does not include non-covered drugs (PDE variable called NCVRD_PLAN_PD_AMT) also does not consider include any applicable rebate amounts or other discounts).

Plans may choose to provide enhanced benefits that pay for some non-covered drugs.

The value will be null if the beneficiary was not enrolled in Part D or did not use any Part D drugs during the year. 



## [Part D PBP Number - April](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/part-d-pbp-number-april)

- Short SAS Name: `PTDPBPID04`
- Long SAS Name: `PTD_PBP_ID_04`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

The variable is the Part D plan benefit package (PBP) for the beneficiary’s Part D plan for a given month (April). CMS assigns an identifier to each PBP within a contract that a Part D plan sponsor has with CMS.

If the beneficiary did not have a Part D plan for a given month, this variable will have null/missing value for that month. If the beneficiary changed plans during the year, the value indicates the final, reconciled PBP number.
For 2006 - 2012, this variable was always encrypted to comply with CMS privacy rules.
There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December). You need to know both the Part D contract number (PTD_CNTRCT_ID_XX) and plan benefit package in order to identify the specific plan in which a beneficiary was enrolled.

This variable is the segment number that CMS assigns to identify a geographic market segment or subdivision of a Part D plan; the segment number allows you to determine the market area covered by the plan. The variable describes the market segment for a given month (March).

If the beneficiary did not have a Part D plan for a given month, this variable will have null/missing value for that month. If the beneficiary changed plans during the year, the value indicates market segment identifier for the final, reconciled PBP. For 2006 - 2012, this variable was always encrypted to comply with CMS privacy rules.
There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).
You need to know the Part D contract number (PTD_CNTRCT_ID_XX) and plan benefit package (PTD_PBP_ID_XX) in order to determine the geographic market areas where the particular PBP was offered. Premiums may vary by market segment.

| CO     | Contractual Obligations -- this group code should be used when a contractual agreement between the payer and payee, or a regulatory requirement, resulted in an adjustment. Generally, these adjustments are considered a write-off for the provider and are not billed to the patient.                 |
| CR     | Corrections and Reversals - this group code should be used for correcting a prior claim. It applies when there is a change to a previously adjudicated claim.                                                                                                                                           |

| PI     | Payer Initiated Reductions -- this group code should be used when, in the opinion of the payer, the adjustment is not the responsibility of the patient, but there is no supporting contract between the provider and the payer (i.e., medical review or professional review organization adjustments). |
| PR     | Patient Responsibility - this group should be used when the adjustment represents an amount that should be billed to the patient or insured. This group would typically be used for deductible and copay adjustments.                                                                                   |

NOTE: Effective October 1, 2007 the OSCAR Provider Number has been renamed the CMS Certification Number (CCN). The name was changed to avoid confusion with the National Provider Identifier (NPI).

## [Research Triangle Institute (RTI) Race Code](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/Research-Triangle-Institute-RTI-Race-Code)

- Short SAS Name: `RTI_RACE_CD`
- Long SAS Name: `RTI_RACE_CD`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

Beneficiary race code (modified using RTI algorithm). Enhanced race/ethnicity designation based on first and last name algorithms.



<h3>Values</h3>

This variable is created by taking the beneficiary race code that has historically been used by the Social Security Administration (and is in turn used in CMS’s enrollment data base) and applying an algorithm that identifies more beneficiaries as Hispanic or Asian. This algorithm was developed by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and is thus often referred to as the “RTI race code”. The algorithm classifies beneficiaries as Hispanic or Asian if their SSA race code equals 4 (Asian) or 5 (Hispanic), or if they have a first or last name that RTI determined was likely Hispanic or Asian in origin.

The variable also incorporates CCW enhancements that reduce the number of beneficiaries with missing information.

Contained in

- [Home Health Agency RIF](../hha-rif.md#data-documentation)

The amount Medicare paid for the services reported on the revenue center record.This field is rarely populated for Part A claims due to per-diem or DRG payments; the claim payment amounts should be used instead.For Hospital Outpatient services (also called Institutional Outpatient claims, which consist of claim type [variable called NCH_CLM_TYPE_CD]= 40), this variable can be summed across all revenue center lines for the claim to obtain the total Medicare claim payment amount.

This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS PRICER software. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals [CAH]); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.
Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.
Additional information regarding claim versus revenue-line level payments can be found in a CCW Technical Guidance document entitled: "Getting Started with Medicare Administrative Data."

Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.

NOTE2: Beginning with NCH weekly process date 7/7/00, this field will be populated with data. Claims processed prior to 7/7/00 will contain spaces in this field.

| CO     | Contractual Obligations -- this group code should be used when a contractual agreement between the payer and payee, or a regulatory requirement, re- sulted in an adjustment. Generally, these adjust- ments are considered a write-off for the provider and are not billed to the patient.             |
| CR     | Corrections and Reversals -- this group code should be used for correcting a prior claim. It applies when there is a change to a previously adjudicated claim.                                                                                                                                          |

| PI     | Payer Initiated Reductions -- this group code should be used when, in the opinion of the payer, the adjustment is not the responsibility of the patient, but there is no supporting contract between the provider and the payer (i.e., medical review or professional review organization adjustments). |
| PR     | Patient Responsibility -- this group should be used when the adjustment represents an amount that should be billed to the patient or insured. This group would typically be used for deductible and copay adjustments.                                                                                  |

Effective with Version 'I', the amount of coinsurance applicable to the line item service defined by the revenue center and HCPCS codes. For those services subject to Outpatient PPS, the applicable coinsurance is wage adjusted.

NOTE1: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. The above claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.

NOTE2: This field will have either a zero (for services for which coinsurance is not applicable), a regular coinsurance amount (calculated on either charges or a fee schedule) or if subject to OP PPS the national coinsurance amount will be wage adjusted. The wage adjusted coinsurance is based on the MSA where the provider is located or assigned as a result of a reclassification.

NOTE3: It has been discovered that this field may be populated with data on claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 (implementation of Claim Line Expansion OPPS/HHPPS). The original understanding of the new revenue center fields was that data would be populated on claims with dates of service 7/00 and forward.

Effective with Version 'I', this code represents a factor that specifies the amount of any APC discount. The discounting factor is applied to a line item with a service indicator (part of the REV_CNTR_PMT_MTHD_IND_CD) of 'T'. The flag is applicable when more than one significant procedure is performed. **If there is no dis- counting the factor will be 1.0.**

NOTE1: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.

Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.

NOTE2: It has been discovered that this field may be populated with data on claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 (implementation of Claim Line Expansion OPPS/HHPPS). The original understanding of the new revenue center fields was that data would be populated on claims with dates of service 7/00 and forward. Data has been found in claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 because the Standard Systems have processed any claim coming in 7/00 and after, meeting the above criteria, through the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) regardless of the dates of service.

NOTE3: VALUES D, U & T REPRESENT THE FOLLOWING: D = Discounting fraction (currently 0.5) U = Number of units T = Terminated procedure discount (currently 0.5)

The Health Care Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) is a collection of codes that represent procedures, supplies, products and services which may be provided to Medicare beneficiaries and to individuals enrolled in private health insurance programs. The codes are divided into three levels, or groups as described below:

Level I: Codes and descriptors copyrighted by the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition (CPT-4).  These are 5 position numeric codes representing physician and nonphysician services.

*Note: CPT-4 codes including both long and short descriptions shall be used in accordance with the CMS/AMA agreement.  Any other use violates the AMA copyright.

Level II: Includes codes and descriptors copyrighted by the American Dental Association's Current Dental Terminology, Fifth Edition (CDT-5).  These are 5 position alpha-numeric codes comprising the D series.  All other level II codes and descriptors are approved and maintained jointly by the alpha-numeric editorial panel (consisting of CMS, the Health Insurance Association of America, and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association).  These are 5 position alpha-numeric codes representing primarily items and nonphysician services that are not represented in the level I codes.

Level III: Codes and descriptors developed by Medicare carriers for use at the local (carrier) level. These are 5 position alpha-numeric codes in the W, X, Y or Z series representing physician and nonphysician services that are not represented in the level I or level II codes.

NOTE2: It has been discovered that this field may be populated with data on claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 (implementation of Claim Line Expansion OPPS/HHPPS). The original understanding of the new revenue center fields was that data would be populated on claims with dates of service 7/00 and forward. Data has been found in claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 because the Standard Systems have processed any claim coming in 7/00 and after, meeting the above criteria, through the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) regardless of the dates of service.

Effective with Version I, the amount paid by the beneficiary to the provider for the line item service.

NOTE1: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.

Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.

ANAMOLY: For dates of service August 1, 2000 to present, the OPPS revenue center fields are being processed differently by FISS and APASS (standard systems). For more information on OPPS data problems for this time period see the Limitations Appendix. The following is how each system is handling this field:

FISS: populating correctly (sum of coinsurance and deductible)

APASS: not populating this field

Currently, the following FI numbers are under the APASS system and all other FI numbers are under FISS. See FI_NUM table of codes for all FI numbers.

Effective with Version 'I', the code used to identify how the service is priced for payment. This field is made up of two pieces of data, 1st position being the service indicator and the 2nd position being the payment indicator.

NOTE1: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.

Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.

NOTE3: Effective 10/2005, this field will no longer represent the service indicator and the payment indicator. This field will now house the 2-byte payment indicator. The status indicator will be housed in a new field named: REV_CNTR_STUS_IND_CD.

NOTE: Prior to 10/2005, this table contained the valid values for both the payment indicator and status indicator.  Effective 10/2005, the payment indicator codes will remain in this table and the status indicator code values will be reflected in the new table: REV_CNTR_STUS_IND_TB. Both the payment indicator and status indicator values have been expanded to 2-btyes.

The code used to identify if there was a deviation from the standard method of calculating payment amount.

This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through the Outpatient PPS PRICER software. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X,13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals [CAH]); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.
Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.
It has been discovered that this field may be populated with data on claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 (implementation of Claim Line Expansion OPPS/HHPPS). The original understanding of the new revenue center fields was that data would be populated on claims with dates of service 7/00 and forward. Data has been found in claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 because the Standard Systems have processed any claim coming in 7/00 and after, meeting the above criteria, through the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) regardless of the dates of service.
VALUES D, U & T REPRESENT THE FOLLOWING:
D = Discounting fraction (currently 0.5)
U = Number of units

Effective with Version 'I', the amount paid to the provider for the services reported on the line item.

NOTE1: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.

Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.

ANAMOLY: For dates of service August 1, 2000 to the present, the OPPS revenue center fields are being processed differently by FISS and APASS (standard systems). For more information on OPPS data problems for this time period see Limitations Appendix. The following is how each system handles this field:

FISS: populated correctly with provider payment amount

APASS: provider payment amount plus interest on 1st revenue center line (CMM will instruct APASS not to include interest)

Currently, the following FI numbers are under the APASS system and all other FI numbers are under FISS. See FI_NUM table of codes for all FI numbers. 52280 -- Mutual of Omaha (until 6/1/2003) 00430 -- Washington/Alaska (until 11/1/2003) 00310 -- North Carolina BC (until 12/1/2003) 00370 -- Rhode Island (until 2/1/2004) 00270 -- New Hampshire/Vermont (until 3/1/2004) 00181 -- Maine/Massachusetts (until 5/1/2004)

NOTE2: It has been discovered that this field may be populated with data on claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 (implementation of Claim Line Expansion OPPS/HHPPS). The original understanding of the new revenue center fields was that data would be populated on claims with dates of service 7/00 and forward. Data has been found in claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 because the Standard Systems have processed any claim coming in 7/00 and after, meeting the above criteria, through the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) regardless of the dates of service.

Charges relating to unit cost associated with the revenue center code. Exception (encounter data only): If plan (e.g. MCO) does not know the actual rate for the accommodations, $1 will be reported in the field.

NOTE1: For SNF PPS claims (when revenue center code equals `0022`), CMS has developed a SNF PRICER to compute the rate based on the provider supplied coding for the MDS RUGS III group and assessment type (HIPPS code, stored in revenue center HCPCS code field).

NOTE2: For OP PPS claims, CMS has developed a PRICER to compute the rate based on the Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC), discount factor, units of service and the wage index.

NOTE3: Under HH PPS (when revenue center code equals `0023`), CMS has developed a HHA PRICER to compute the rate. On the RAP, the rate is determined using the case mix weight associated with the HIPPS code, adjusting it for the wage index for the beneficiary's site of service, then multiplying the result by 60% or 50%, depending on whether or not the RAP is for a first episode.

On the final claim, the HIPPS code could change the payment if the therapy threshold is not met, or partial episode payment (PEP) adjustment or a significant change in condition (SCIC) adjustment. In cases of SCICs, there will be more than one `0023` revenue center line, each representing the payment made at each case-mix level.

NOTE4: For IRF PPS claims (when revenue center code equals `0024`), CMS has developed a PRICER to compute the rate based on the HIPPS/CMG (HIPPS code, stored in revenue center HCPCS code field).

Effective 10/3/2005 with the implementation of NCH/NMUD CR#2, the code used to identify the status of the line item service. This field along with the payment method indicator field is used to identify how the service was priced for payment.

NOTE1: This 2-byte indicator is being added due to an expansion of a field that currently exist on the revenue center trailer. The status indicator is currently the 1st position of the Revenue Center Payment Method Indicator Code. The payment method indicator code is being split into two 2-byte fields (payment indicator and status indicator). The expanded payment indicator will continue to be stored in the existing payment method indicator field. The split of the current payment method indicator field is due to the expansion of both pieces of date from 1-byte to 2-bytes.

NOTE2: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.

Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services.

The total charges (covered and non-covered) for all accommodations and services (related to the revenue code) for a billing period before reduction for the deductible and coinsurance amounts and before an adjustment for the cost of services provided. NOTE: For accommodation revenue center total charges must equal the rate times units (days).

EXCEPTIONS:

(1) For SNF RUGS demo claims only (9000 series revenue center codes), this field contains SNF customary accommodation charge, (ie., charges related to the accommodation revenue center code that would have been applicable if the provider had not been participating in the demo).

(2) For SNF PPS (non demo claims), when revenue center code = `0022`, the total charges will be zero.

(3) For Home Health PPS (RAPs), when revenue center code = `0023`, the total charges will equal the dollar amount for the `0023` line.

(4) For Home Health PPS (final claim), when revenue center code = `0023`, the total charges will be the sum of the revenue center code lines (other than `0023`).

(5) For Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IFR) PPS, when the revenue center code = `0024`, the total charges will be zero. For accommodation revenue codes (010X - 021X), total charges must equal the rate times the units.

(6) For encounter data, if the plan (e.g. MCO) does not know the actual charges for the accommodations the total charges will be $1 (rate) times units (days).

??? limitation
	DESCRIPTION :
	Multiple total charge '0001' revenue center codes appearing
	on outpatient, hospice and home health claim records.
	BACKGROUND :
	On outpatient, home health and hospice it appears that
	more than one '0001' revenue center code is showing
	up on the claims. The first total charge line adds
	the revenue center codes above it correctly; the
	problem exists below the first total charge line
	where garbage may be present due to the FI Standard
	System not clearing out fields before processing the
	next claim. We believe the error began with the change-
	over to a different claims processing contractor in
	1/98.
	CORRECTIVE ACTION :
	CWF created an edit to reject mulitple '0001' revenue
	center codes, effective 6/28/99. EDG's CWFMQA process
	implemented an edit to drop any revenue center line
	items below the first total charge line. The NCH
	Nearline File, as well as the 1998 Standard Analytic
	Files (SAFs), have been patched/corrected to delete
	the multiple '0001' codes where present on any of the
	institutional claim types. Also, HCIS will be cor-
	recting the revenue center summaries during the next
	refresh.
	The NCH_PATCH_CD field will reflect a value '10'.

A quantitative measure (unit) of the number of times the service or procedure being reported was performed according to the revenue center/HCPCS code definition as described on an institutional claim.

Depending on type of service, units are measured by number of covered days in a particular accommodation, pints of blood, emergency room visits, clinic visits, dialysis treatments (sessions or days), outpatient therapy visits, and outpatient clinical diagnostic laboratory tests.

NOTE1: When revenue center code = `0022` (SNF PPS) the unit count will reflect the number of covered days for each HIPPS code and, if applicable, the number of visits for each rehab therapy code.

This variable indicates whether a beneficiary met the chronic condition data warehouse (CCW) criteria for rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis as of the end of the calendar year.



<h3>Values</h3>

The CCW’s chronic condition flags require beneficiaries to satisfy both claims criteria (a minimum number/type of claims that have the proper diagnosis codes and occurred within a specified time period) and coverage criteria (FFS Part A and Part B coverage during the entire specified time period). For rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis, beneficiaries must have at least two inpatient, SNF, home health, or Part B (institutional or non-institutional) claims that are at least one day apart with a rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis code in any position during the 2-year reference period. The CCW’s criteria were developed after reviewing validated algorithms from the research literature and criteria used by other federal data sources.  You can find more detailed information on the criteria on the CCW website:

This variable indicates the source of enrollment data.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has updated the Medicare enrollment source data for the Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF). As of March 2017, the MBSF includes Medicare enrollment information from the CMS Common Medicare Environment (CME) rather than the CMS Enrollment Database (EDB). Data from the two sources was nearly identical. The CME improves the identification of Medicare Part B enrollment and also allows for more timely release of the MBSF. The universe of beneficiaries in the CME versus the EDB version of the MBSF are only slightly different.

This amount identifies the standardized Medicare payment amount.

This is the standardized amount as determined by PRICER software output.  This amount is never used for payments. It is used for comparisons across different regions of the country for the value-based purchasing initiatives and for research. It is a standard amount, without the geographical payment adjustments and some of the other add-on payments that actually go to the hospitals.    

This field is new in October 2014. This field only applies to Inpatient claims. Note that an additional field is available that further adjusts the standard Medicare Payment amount by applying additional standardization requirements (e.g. sequestration).   

Refer to variable called the final standardized amount (FINL_STD_AMT).

<h3>Values</h3>



This variable counts the total number of months during the year when the beneficiary premium was paid by the state. State Medicaid programs can pay Medicare premiums for certain dual eligibles (i.e., for beneficiaries also enrolled in a state Medicaid program); this action is called “buying in” and so this variable is the “buy-in code.”  Any month where the BUYINXX variable was: A (Part A state buy-in), B (Part B state buy-in), or C(Part A and Part B state buy-in) is counted.

## [Viral Hepatitis (General) End-of-Year Indicator - Medicare Only Claims](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/viral-hepatitis-general-end-year-indicator-medicare-only-claims-0)

- Short SAS Name: `HEPVIRAL_MEDICARE`

Contained in

- [Master Beneficiary Summary File](../mbsf.md#data-documentation)

This variable indicates whether a beneficiary met the condition criteria for viral hepatitis (general) as of the end of the calendar year.

NOTE: The condition variable requires beneficiaries to satisfy both claims criteria (a minimum number/type of Medicare claims that have the proper diagnosis codes and occurred within a specified time period) and coverage criteria (Medicare FFS Part A and Part B coverage during the entire specified time period).

NOTE1: For viral hepatitis (general), beneficiaries must have at least one Medicare inpatient claim or two other non-drug claims of any service type with a related code in any position during the 2-year reference period. You can find more detailed information on the criteria on the CCW website: https://www.ccwdata.org/web/guest/condition-categories

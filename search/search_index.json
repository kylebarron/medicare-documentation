            "text": "Description of the Claims Files\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis documentation is ported from NBER documentation \nhere\n, written by Maurice Dalton.\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\u00b6\n\n\nMedicare is a program in the United States that provides health insurance to individuals with disabilities, end-stage renal disease and for the majority of individuals aged 65 and over. The services which Medicare purchases are covered by three basic parts:\n\n\n\n\nPart A, which primarily covers inpatient services;\n\n\nPart B, which primarily covers physician and outpatient services;\n\n\nPart D, which started operation in 2006 and covers some prescription drugs.\n\n\n\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, typically known as CMS, administers the Medicare program.\n\n\nFor most Medicare enrollees, claims under Part A and Part B are paid directly by Medicare, often termed traditional fee-for-service (FFS). Some Medicare enrollees, however, receive Part A and Part B coverage through private insurance companies.\n1\n These claims are often generically termed HMO claims but more correctly are part of the Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Full claims data are not available for these enrollees which can lead to incomplete costs statistics if beneficiary enrollment is not accounted for. For the years covered by NBER's data collection enrollment in MA plans has been between 5 and 25 percent.\n2\n Since selection into private plans is generally thought to be non-random, this should be kept in mind when working with the data.\n\n\nWhen working with the claims, users are reminded that the claims' primary purpose is as a billing system which has been made available to the research community. As such, having an understanding of Medicare's structure and payment systems is important to fully understand the data. For example, it is often useful to think about the incentives in place for providers to report data. If some claims information is not tied to reimbursement it is difficult to be certain how accurately and consistently the information was reported.\n\n\nOne useful reference for understanding payment systems and Medicare generally is a set of issue briefs produced by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), which advises the US Congress on provider payment issues. The issue briefs are available on MedPAC's \nwebsite\n under the heading \"Medicare Background.\" Also for a more in depth overview of the historical aspects of Medicare, including a brief overview of legislation, see \nDeLew(2000)\n. In addition a brief overview of Medicare payment systems is given in a \nlater section\n.\n\n\nThe following subsections are meant to provide some background to the Medicare claims files, while also explaining some of the idiosyncratic features of the data. As questions arise from using the data, the following subsections should prove to be a useful reference.\n\n\nMedicare claims organizing structure\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn general, the Medicare files are organized by who is getting paid. At a very broad level the claims are split between institutional and non-institutional claims. \nNon-institutional\n claims are those submitted by doctors (carrier files) and durable medical equipment suppliers. \nInstitutional\n files cover everything else (outpatient, inpatient(IP), skilled nursing facility (SNF), hospice and home health agency). CMS offers each type of claims to researchers in separate files, in addition to a beneficiary level \"denominator\" file which provides demographic and enrollment information. The following section provides a brief overview of the types of files available from CMS, their basic structure and how the files fit together.\n\n\nThe majority of Medicare reimbursement can be captured in the \nMedPAR\n, \nCarrier\n and \nOutpatient\n files, which cover the majority of Part A and Part B spending. In some instances, CMS makes more detailed files available. One example is the SNF claims which report more detailed information about SNF PPS reimbursement system, while much of the same information found in the SNF claims files can also be found in the MedPAR file. Generally, users should take some time to appreciate which claims they need to process, and should be careful to avoid using claims which share the same data.\n\n\nThe \nMedPAR\n is unlike any of the other files because it is generated by CMS from the Inpatient and SNF claims. The file aggregates the claims into stays and is generally easier to work with then the raw claims. It is worth noting that the MedPAR file will contain a complete record of all DRGs found in the inpatient payment systems because DRGs are assigned retrospectively after discharge. The MedPAR file, however, does not report physician identifiers and may constitute one reason to work with the inpatient file, nor does it have SNF RUG codes. A new user should decide whether they will need to use the MedPAR file or the inpatient and/or SNF claims. Using both file types would be redundant and result in double counting of claims. Also beginning in 2008, the MedPAR files began including all no pay Medicare Advantage(MA) plan beneficiaries in addition to FFS individuals.\n\n\nAnother unique file offered by CMS is the \ndenominator\n file, which switched over to the \nbeneficiary service file\n in 2009. The file is reported at the beneficiary level in order to report relevant demographic information (age, sex, race, and date of death) and enrollment status information for all Medicare enrollees. The date of death is interesting in its own right and is discussed in more detail \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaims File\n\n\nFile Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenominator\n\n\nDemographic and enrollment data on enrollees, the enrollment file is derived from the Denominators files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHHA\n\n\nHome health agency claims\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient\n\n\nInpatient claims cover all inpatient claims ONLY. These claims overlap with the inpatient claims found in the MedPAR file. In general the Inpatient holds a slightly more detailed accounting of claims then the MedPAR file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNF\n\n\nSkilled nursing facility (SNF) claims\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\nStay-based (rather than claim based) file with information on all inpatient and SNF stays; generally easier to work with than the Inpatient and SNF claims files. Constructed from SNF and Inpatient files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInst Files\n\n\nThese files track the condition code, occurrence code, span code, and value code files from the CMS Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) data files from the institutional files, see \nhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nClaims for services performed by non-institutional providers, notably physicians\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient\n\n\nClaims for outpatient services performed by institutional providers in an outpatient setting. Examples of institutional outpatient providers include hospital outpatient departments, rural health clinics, renal dialysis facilities, outpatient rehabilitation facilities, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities, and community mental health centers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHospice\n\n\nHospice claims\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDME\n\n\nDurable medical equipment claims (excepting the small number that appear in the Carrier file)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermining enrollment of the target population\n\u00b6\n\n\nNot all patients found in the raw claims files have complete billing information because care is paid for by Medicare in two different ways:\n\n\n\n\nthrough traditional fee-for-service (FFS) or\n\n\nthrough a managed care component sometimes generally referred to as an HMO or Medicare Advantage (MA).\n\n\n\n\nSince the Medicare claims database is an administrative data set whose function is to track billing to traditional FFS, HMOs are not required to submit their bills to CMS. Understanding this distinction is very important to defining your samples correctly.\n\n\nThe type of coverage a beneficiary is enrolled in will determine whether a provider bills through FFS or whether the bill is processed by a managed care organization. Making sure the correct \nenrollment restrictions\n are used ensures estimated statistics use a complete set of claims. The enrollment restrictions are needed because HMOs are not required to bill through their claims and therefore are not necessarily complete, if they are even billed through at all. The uncertainty surrounding what an HMO chose to report makes it very important to make sure we subset beneficiaries to those enrolled in traditional FFS and not HMO during the time period of interest. For example, if you are looking at 30-day costs after an AMI, you should at the very least make sure that your beneficiaries are enrolled in FFS in the month of the index event and 1-month after the index event date.\n\n\nEnrollment information is found in the Denominator files and is reported at a monthly level. Two separate variables are used to determine whether an individual is in traditional FFS or whether a beneficiary is serviced by a managed care organization. The FFS variables (\nBUYIN01\n-\nBUYIN12\n) report whether the individual has Part A, Part B or both Part A and B. There are some responses denoting whether they fall under Medicaid (state-buyins). When we talk about traditional FFS we mean having both Part A and B coverage, regardless of whether is a state buy-in or not. The number associated with the buy-in variable denotes the month.\n\n\nThe second variable reports whether an individual is enrolled in an HMO, these variables are labeled \nHMOIND01\n-\nHMOIND12\n where the number references the month of enrollment information (\n01\n = January). Combining individuals who are in Part A and Part B and not serviced by an HMO is what is routinely referred to as traditional FFS.\n\n\nIn addition to the raw files a processed file has been created to aid researchers looking to enforce enrollment restrictions. The code which generates this can be found in the following directory \n0PrePRocessPrgm/enroll_denomFiles\n.\n\n\nMortality data in the claims data\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe following borrows heavily from the ResDAC website and the transcripts from their trainings.\n\n\nMortality data in the claims data is found in the denominator file, which is reported annually at the patient level. The denominator files contain general person level information like gender, date of birth, enrollment, patient zip code from SSA database and date of death if they had passed.\n\n\nFor a very small amount of cases in the denominator file an individual is reported dead in one year but is no longer reported dead in the following year. These individuals are assumed to not have died.\n\n\nThere are two date of death variables found in the denominator file, one which has been validated and one which has not. It turns out the date of death variable is not always exact in part because of the way it is processed. The date of death information comes from the Social Security Administration. However, every night CMS checks its claims for people discharged as dead and it flags these people. CMS in turn sends these individuals a letter basically saying \"We think you may have died. Did you?\u201d. They do this because the date of death is used as the last date Medicare needs to provide services and they do not want to cut off services too early. As a result, in some cases where they do not have proper documentation they move the date of death to the end of the month to make sure they are not cutting of services too early.\n\n\nTranscripts of ResDac training\n\n\nSee the following RESDAC transcript from a training for more information.\n\n\nUnderstanding how the files fit together\n\u00b6\n\n\nEach claims file (e.g. Carrier file) reports Medicare reimbursement and utilization by the type of provider being paid (i.e. Carrier file does include reimbursements made to hospitals, mostly physicians). Note that each sample (e.g. 5% ) will track the same individuals across all of the files, that is, the sampling is not done at the claim level, but rather the beneficiary level. Specifically, the 5 percent extracts contain records for all enrollees whose social security numbers have eight and ninth digits of \n05\n, \n20\n, \n45\n, \n70\n, or \n95\n. Similarly, the 20 percent extracts contain all enrollees whose encrypted HICs have a ninth digit of \n0\n or \n5\n. Because these digits are essentially random, the resulting extracts constitute a representative sample of the Medicare population. \n3\n What this means is that in order to describe the complete reimbursement, for say Part B spending, users would need to combine reimbursements found in the Carrier and Outpatient file of the same sample.\n\n\nA pair of examples will best help illustrate which costs the claims files cover for a sample index event. Suppose an individual is admitted into a hospital where a physician performs a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in the inpatient setting. The physician portion of costs for this initial episode of care would be found in the Carrier file and the reimbursement going to the hospital for the general care provided and use of the structure would be found in the Inpatient and MedPAR file, although using both the Inpatient and MedPAR file would be redundant.\n\n\nNext assume that the patient is released to an outpatient setting where he is monitored via an EKG continuously. The Carrier file would still be billed for the physician's role in interpreting the EKG whereas the Outpatient file would contain the reimbursement for the machine and the administered EKG (assuming the physician did not do it). Note that while some procedures occur in the outpatient setting, they may be billed to the inpatient PPS, despite showing up in the outpatient claims. In these cases the reimbursement will only appear in the inpatient claims, whereas the outpatient claim will have zero reimbursement associated.\n\n\nThe second example consists of a patient getting a mammogram in the outpatient facility. The administration of the mammogram and the use of the machinery would be billed to the outpatient setting, whereas the interpretation of the results by the physician would be billed to the carrier file. Screening mammograms are not paid through the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) but are still found in the outpatient files. They are reimbursed based on a fee schedule. In addition, providers may qualify for other add-on payments if, for example, the provider uses computer aided detection. Next, doctor related costs, like interpreting the mammogram would be found in the Carrier files.\n\n\nWhile these two examples attempt to clear up how to extract costs, it is important to keep in mind that these are simplified examples and that the claims may have instances where this logic is not followed, especially as one wades into the older data. The outpatient files are especially difficult to work with because they combine several different types of providers, which fall under an \"outpatient setting\" description but who are reimbursed through different systems. In addition, the outpatient providers may be forced to bundle certain payments which complicates things further. Refer to \nsection 6.2\n.\n\n\nClaims data references\n\u00b6\n\n\nA wide variety of useful information on the claims files is available from ResDAC, an organization at the University of Minnesota that is under CMS contract to provide support to users of the claims data. The ResDAC website contains a wealth of information on the claims data. Highlights include:\n\n\n\n\nDescriptions of which claims files contain information on which types of providers\n\n\nData dictionaries for recent versions of the claims files\n\n\nA list of frequently asked questions about the claims data\n\n\nThe \nChronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW)\n provides technical documentation and some useful summary statistics for the extracts they create (although they are not directly comparable with the extract the NBER extraction programs produce)\n\n\nThis file\n has some useful information about the claims, although the document is specific to linking the claims files to the NCHS Survey which is not covered by the programs developed here at the NBER\n\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that there are considerable differences between the summary statistics the CCW publishes on their website and those associated with the extracts created by these programs. For example, the CCW extracts use inpatient claims files, not the MedPAR file. In addition the CCW does not place any restrictions on the data which they summarize, as the extracts associated with this documentation do. Lastly, even if you compare the raw MedPAR file count to those in the CCW, the 2008 MedPAR file includes all no-pay MA individuals and the counts will not be comparable without some further manipulation. While ResDAC does not create the CCW files they do in fact answer any questions users have about the data.\n\n\nIn ResDAC's parlance, NBER holds \"Research Identifiable Files,\" that is, files that contain detailed personal information on Medicare enrollees. In addition to the resources available on the ResDAC website, ResDAC also answers questions through email or phone conversation. Other useful resources besides ResDAC include the following:\n\n\n\n\nA good overview of the Medicare data and specific issues regarding coding and such can be found in Chapter 5 of Risk Adjustment for Measuring Health Care Outcomes by Lisa I. Iezzoni.\n\n\nOld data dictionaries and documentation have been scanned and placed on the servers. These are the code books which are available from the NBER Medicare documentation home\n\n\nThe Internet-Only Manuals (IOM) are a place of last resort. They provide the official CMS regulations for processing the claims files. As one might suspect they are a bit dense, but often provide comprehensive explanation of how the claims are currently processed. In some instances they also provide a historical overview of how the claims were processed.\n\n\n\n\nResDAC data dictionaries\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nInpatient\n\n\nOutpatient\n\n\nSkilled Nursing Facility (SNF)\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nDurable Medical Equipment (DME)\n\n\nHome Health Agency (HHA)\n\n\nHospice\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR construction notes from ResDAC\n\u00b6\n\n\nEffective with the 9/96 update the 1995 MedPAR was created as follows:\n\n\n\n\nEach month Inpatient and SNF claims are accumulated from the NCH Nearline repository.\n\n\nAt the end of each quarter, the monthly files are merged into a database containing all claims for the current year and prior two years. The database is processed through the final action algorithms.\n\n\nThe final actioned database is split into two segments for each year. Inpatient claims with discharge dates and SNF claims with admission dates in January through September are in the first segment; claims with dates in October through December are in the second segment. This allows for the creation of fiscal year or calendar year files as needed.\n\n\nThe claims remaining from the final action processing are collapsed by claim number, admission date, and provider number (all in ascending order) to create a stay record. The records are further sorted by claim from date, claim thru date (both in ascending order), HCFA process date (descending), and query code (descending) and the results are used to create MedPAR.\n\n\n\n\nChanging identifiers in the raw data (HIC switchers)\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn general there are two related instances where an individual's identifier may change and cause the individual to exit the sample. A beneficiary's identifier can change if the social security number (SSN) granting entitlement changes (see below for discussion), causing the individual to appear in the claims as two separate patients. As a result of a change in an SSN, the individual may disappear from the 5 or 20% samples due to sample method reliance on SSNs.\n\n\nIt's important to understand the beneficiary identifiers found in the data before discussing the special case of HIC switchers. A beneficiary's unique identifier, known as the enrollee's Health Insurance Claim (HIC) number, is constructed using the enrollee's SSN and a suffix indicating the enrollee's reason for Medicare eligibility. Some individuals' eligibility may change over time, resulting in a change in their HIC; or in some other instances an individual's SSN will change resulting in a change in their identifier \n4\n.\n\n\nWhile individuals whose HIC has changed presents the possibility of interpreting the HICs in the claims as two separate individuals, this would only occur if the new HIC is still in the sample of interest. Although \nbene_id\ns are able to track HIC switchers over time, the \nbene_id\n does not solve the issue resulting from an individual experiencing a HIC change which causes them to drop out of the sample for example. To account for this, beginning in 2006, CMS began producing an enhanced five percent sample, which keeps individuals in the sample once they have been selected from the 5% sample and a strict 5% sample which matches the sample found in the earlier years. This is useful for tracking individuals over time. A strict 5% sample can be obtained by keeping records where the \nFIVEPCT\n variable is \nY\n from the denominator files. The extract we create uses a strict 5% sample.\n\n\nNote that HICs are falling out of the sample at a rate of about 2 percent a year. This could be problematic if you decide to follow individuals over long period of time (as we do).\n\n\nTo reiterate the point an identifier in the claims data can change in two related ways:\n\n\n\n\nA beneficiary HIC may change in some manner causing the beneficiary to appear as two distinct individuals. The new \nbene_id\n solves this problem.\n\n\nWhen dealing with sample extracts smaller then the 100% files, a beneficiary whose HIC changes may drop out of the sample depending on what their new HIC is, since the sampling is dependent on the HIC number. The new \nbene_id\n DOES NOT solve this problem.\n\n\n\n\nThe transition from EHICs to \nbene_id\ns (Post 2006 data)\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs noted in the previous section, CMS transitioned from using HICs to \nbene_id\ns starting in 2006. In a very small percent of cases, individual HICs have changed over time. The new \nbene_id\ns look to fix this issue by creating a truly unique ID for each beneficiary, for which CMS has provided a HIC to \nbene_id\n crosswalk. This means that when merging old EHICs to the crosswalk, in a very small amount of cases, several EHICs can be mapped to a single \nbene_id\n. When dealing with the 5% and 20% extracts, not all EHICs associated with a single \nbene_id\n will necessarily be in these random samples.\n\n\nCMS has made available a crosswalk which maps EHICs to \nbene_id\ns over time. The current program first creates a 5, 20, or 100% sample of the crosswalk. Sub-setting the crosswalk file saves space and also avoids merging in individuals whose EHIC changed and as a result is no longer in the strict 5% sample. Next the crosswalk is applied annually to the EHICs for data before 2006. The crosswalk is incomplete in the sense that about 10% of all EHICs do not have a corresponding \nbene_id\n, in these cases the EHIC is used in place of the missing \nbene_id\n.\n\n\nDiagnosis and procedure codes\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe SAS extraction code builds cohorts by identifying the index event, the claim which represents the start of an episode of care, by using diagnostic or procedure codes. The codes will both limit and define the type of cohort that can be built from the Medicare data and as such warrants further discussion about the different coding systems found in the claims.\n\n\nThe two major coding systems found in the Medicare claims files are the HCPCS and ICD-9-CM codes. The HCPCS codes cover procedures only, where as the ICD-9-CM codes have diagnostic and procedure codes available. All claims files use the International Classification of Diseases, Version 9, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic codes; the MedPAR file also uses the ICD-9-CM procedure codes. The HCPCS codes provide a more detailed framework for documenting specific aspects of the claims and are based on CPT and CMS derived codes. The greater specificity of the codes is a major reason they are used to describe procedures in the carrier line item and outpatient revenue center level files.\n\n\nICD-9-CM diagnostic and procedure codes\n\u00b6\n\n\nICD-9-CM codes and coding behavior are constantly evolving to keep track with advances in medicine. Changes in coding behavior create potential issues with constructing a longitudinal cohort. Caution should be taken to ensure that all the codes of interest are used to create cohorts and any changes in coding behavior understood. The official coding guidelines are determined by the Central Office on ICD-9-CM after being approved by the ICD-9-CM Coordination-Maintenance Committee at NCHS, CMS, American Health Information Management Association and American Hospital Association. The official coding guidelines are published in the AHA Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM, a quarterly publication (\nIezzoni, 2003,pg 96\n).\n\n\nDatasets with ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes can be downloaded from CMS at the links in the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICD Version\n\n\nYear\n\n\nLink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICD-9-CM\n\n\n2005-2014\n\n\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICD-10-CM\n\n\n2014\n\n\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICD-10-CM\n\n\n2015\n\n\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICD-10-CM\n\n\n2016\n\n\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICD-10-CM\n\n\n2017\n\n\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICD-10-CM\n\n\n2018\n\n\nlink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the late 1990s through the present, ICD-9-CM code books are available from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) \nhere\n.\n\n\nWhen written formally, ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes have the format \nXXX.XX\n and ICD-9-CM procedure codes have the format \nXX.XX\n, where the \nX\ns represent digits 0-9. The codes are often referred to in the literature by listing all codes explicitly or by referring to an entire hierarchy by allowing an \nX\n to signify any digit. For example, \n410.X1\n refers to \n410.71\n but not \n410.72\n.\n\n\nThe claims files store these codes as strings, including any leading zeros and, almost always, excluding the decimal point \n5\n. Correspondingly, even though some codes may not have a full five digits (either because one of the trailing digits is not necessary or has been omitted), it is generally not difficult to determine which of a code's digits correspond to digits before the decimal.\n\n\nThis document\n is the CMS IOM pdf which provides an overview of the HCPCS (pronounced \"hic picks\") codes used in the processing of the claims. The PDF in general provides a complete overview of how the HCPCS and ICD9-CM codes are used.\n\n\nICD-9-CM in the claims files\n\u00b6\n\n\nDiagnosis codes are sequenced in the MedPAR data, with the first diagnosis code classified as the principal diagnosis and the remaining diagnoses referred to as a secondary diagnoses or comorbidities. In addition, the admitting diagnosis is also coded, although it is less commonly used in research. CMS states that the principal diagnosis is \"the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for the admission.\" In other words, the principal diagnosis is based on admitting information in addition to the findings during the hospital stay. Beginning in 2008, the MedPAR file includes a variable (\nPOA_IND\n) which flags whether a condition was present at admission.\n\n\nOutpatient claims do not have a principal diagnosis; instead they report first listed diagnosis. That is, instead of a diagnosis, outpatient claims list the diagnosis codes in the order of most to least certain. This is complicated because some insurance companies require clinicians to follow a principal-type diagnosis reporting in order to ensure that filed claims match the diagnosis. The resulting reported diagnosis are inconsistent and we cannot be certain about which coding paradigm was followed (\nIezzoni, 2003, pg 105\n).\n\n\nHealth care Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS)\n\u00b6\n\n\nCMS' Health care Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) combines two sets of codes:\n\n\n\n\nThe American Medical Association's numeric Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes I and II;\n\n\nCMS' alpha-numeric \"Level II\" HCPCS codes, which cover services for which no CPT code exists\n6\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nDatasets with HCPCS codes and short descriptions from 2003 to the present are freely available on the CMS website in their \nRelative Value Files\n. In the \nRVU15A.zip\n file, for example, the \nPPRRVU15_V1223c.csv\n, \nPPRRVU15_V1223c.txt\n, and \nPPRRVU15_V1223c.xlsx\n files contain an \nHCPCS\n variable with the code and a \nDESCRIPTION\n variable with the short description. These CMS files are released under the \nEnd User Point and Click Agreement\n. \n7\n\n\n\n\nMost procedures of interest are covered by core CPT codes, rather than the \"Level II\" codes. Note that a researcher looking to study a procedure using a set of CPT, CPT-II or HCPCS codes can find the codes in the data under the HCPCS variable since HCPCS codes include the CPT, CPT-II and additional CMS codes.\n\n\nUnfortunately, because the American Medical Association (AMA) retains copyright over the CPT portion of the HCPCS, there are essentially no comprehensive electronic HCPCS references. \n8\n However CMS freely distributes CPT short descriptions along with their \nRelative Value Files\n, with an \nEnd User Point and Click Agreement\n stating that the documents are for organizations' internal use and not for commercial use. Similar manuals also exist for the Level II HCPCS codes, although NBER currently has no plans to acquire them. In recent years, detailed descriptions of the Level II codes are available for download from CMS \nhere\n.\n\n\nAnother potential source of information on HCPCS codes is the Medicare physician fee schedule, which provides short descriptions of each code. From its inception through the present, the fee schedule is available from the \nFederal Register\n, although finding precisely where it appears and extracting the information is difficult. From 2003 through the present, the fee schedule can be downloaded in spreadsheet form from the CMS website \nhere\n.\n\n\nBeginning in 2005\n9\n HCPCS codes are reported. According to a MedPAC report, outpatient facilities began using HCPCS codes in place of ICD-9-CM codes on July 1, 1987 \n10\n. Examining the claims files, however, suggests that the transition from ICD-9-CM to HCPCS procedure codes was not as clean as this would suggest. Consequently, in many cases, it may be advisable to identify procedures using both sets of codes into the 1990s.\n\n\nThe HCPCS codes have a technical and professional component associated with each code. The professional component refers to the services provided by a physician like interpreting an x-ray or the results of a tests. Where as the technical component refers to the act of giving the test. Some HCPCS codes, like \n93005\n, giving an EKG, are 100% technical by the very nature of the code. Other HCPCS codes need to be paired with the HCPCS modifier codes. HCPCS codes that are tagged with modifier of \n26\n denotes the professional component only where as a \nTC\n denotes the technical component.\n\n\nThe importance of understanding whether an HCPCS code is a technical or professional component arises because it determines how the procedure is reimbursed. For example if you look at the AMI cohort you find that there are many instances of \n71010\n, a chest x-ray. According to reimbursement rule, x-rays done at a hospital have the technical component billed through the institution and the professional component billed through the carrier file (with modifier \n26\n). However in cases where a x-ray was done at a physicians office, then the physician bills for both the technical and professional component of the x-ray.\n\n\nHCPCS procedure codes in the claims\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn some sense, it is useful to think of HCPCS codes as a more detailed accounting than the ICD-9-CM procedure codes. Since they are able to provide a finer level of detail, it follows that the HCPCS codes can better describe the procedures used at the line item or revenue center level of the claims files. HCPCS codes are found in the line or revenue center portion of the claims files.\n\n\nPatient residence information\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor many types of analysis, it is useful to have information on where patients live. Each claims record contains fields for the patient's zip code, county, and state of residence. Virtually all claims generated by institutions (i.e. inpatient, SNF, and outpatient claims) contain data in these fields. However, these fields are blank on a few percent of non-institutional claims (notably, physician claims).\n\n\nIn principle, information on patients' locations of residence is also available from the annual beneficiary level denominator files. The information in these files, however, corresponds to the beneficiary's residence when the file was finalized March 31\nst\n of the following year. As a result, the residence information in this file will not, in general, correspond to residence at the time of treatment. \n11\n\n\nAdding denominator based zip codes from the extracts would not be difficult. It is important to realize what is included are the zip codes from the associated claims/MedPAR files. Refer to \nResDAC FAQ\n for more information on why the residence information may differ.\n\n\nProvider and physician identifiers\n\u00b6\n\n\nProvider and physician identifiers are included in the claims files. In the case of physicians these identifiers have changed from UPINs to NPI over time. While the method for generating provider numbers has not changed it is important to note that it is possible for these provider numbers to change in some cases.\n\n\nProvider identifiers\n\u00b6\n\n\nProvider numbers are a rich source of information for researchers. The number itself provides information on the state a provider is registered under in the first 2 digits while the last 4 digits fall into number range CMS uses to classify provider types (e.g. short-term inpatient versus SNF provider) \n12\n.\n\n\nThe last four digits generally describe the type of provider, although in a small amount of cases they have been found to be misleading. While comparing the long-term care and inpatient facilities there were some facilities which appeared to have been inpatient facilities but who were billing as a long-term care facility. Closer inspection suggested that ownership had changed and the facility had switched over to the long-term care payment system while leaving its provider number intact. Again in most of the cases the provider numbers will be correct, but there are exceptions to this rule. Researchers concerned with this can use the impact file for the different payment systems to match provider numbers to the payment system. In above example, the anomaly was discovered by comparing the impact files.\n\n\nIt is important to realize that institutional provider numbers can change over time with a change in ownership or if CMS decides on it. Individuals concerned about changing provider IDs can look to the provider of service (POS) file. The file contains provider centric data, including provider address and a cross reference of new and old provider IDs, although the crosswalk has not been verified. Although both the address and the crosswalk may provide some information, generally the POS file needs to be processed further because of inconsistency in the data over the years. The NBER currently holds the POS data set. For more information about the POS files check \nhere\n or \nhere\n.\n\n\nSome inpatient facilities in rural settings with less then 100 beds can apply to have special swing bed designation. The designation allows some beds in an inpatient setting to provide long-term care without establishing a separate unit which is eligible for reimbursement based on a reasonable cost bases. However, providers who bill using the swing bed designation will have a different provider number then when they bill for their regular inpatient services. Swing bed inpatient facilities are designated by provider numbers with a \nU\n in the 5\nth\n position of the 6 digit provider number or by the \nspclunit\n variable populated with a \nU\n,\nW\n,\nY\n, or \nZ\n.\n\n\nPhysician identifiers\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe types of physician identifiers available vary by year. Across all years, the vast majority of physician claims provide tax identification numbers (either SSNs or EINs). The vast majority of physician records also provide CMS-issued PIN and UPIN identifiers \n13\n.\n\n\nHistorically CMS has made a complete listing of physician identifier available. The UPIN directory was last updated Q2, 2007 available \nhere\n and was replaced with the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System's NPI \nregistry\n. The NPI is currently available to the public and does include legacy IDs, which may include the UPIN. The NBER has generated a UPIN to NPI crosswalk from the registry available \nhere\n.\n\n\nA brief overview of UPINs is described in the rest of the section. NPI are not discussed in more detail because they are new and contain no information within them. Over time there has been many inconsistencies in how UPINs were defined. [^18] To better understand the source of such inconsistencies it is useful to understand how physicians and institutions bill for services. When a physician bills for a service, they enter in their PINs, which the carrier runs through a crosswalk to assign the given PIN a UPIN. The problem is the quality of the crosswalk has varied by carrier over time generating a major source of inconsistencies.\n\n\nOn the other hand when a provider submits a bill headed for the institutional claims files they provide the UPIN directly. This means that the institutional files do not have the same crosswalk issue as the institutional files. For a full explanation of the process refer to the ResDAC technical document \nMedicare Physician Identifiers UPINs, PINs and NPI Numbers\n.\n\n\nLastly it is useful to note that the first letter in the UPIN designated the doctor type:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Letter\n\n\nType of Practitioner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-M\n\n\nMedical doctors (medical doctors and doctors of osteopathy)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT-V\n\n\nOther doctors (such as chiropractors, dentists, podiatrists and optometrists)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR-S\n\n\nNon-physician practitioners\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW-Z\n\n\nGroup UPINs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHospital transfers\n\u00b6\n\n\nData patterns which resemble potential hospital transfers in the MedPAR records are presented in this section under three different scenarios. The importance of these different transfer scenarios will ultimately rest on the specific question at hand. As a result these different scenarios are simply flagged in the data and left to the user to decide on how to treat them. For the four cohorts extracted (AMIs, CHF, ACS, and hip fractures) the second scenario encompasses the majority of index events flagged as potential transfers. Although this transfer scenario is the largest for AMIs and has steadily increased over time. By the end of the time series, more than 5% of the annual AMI index events are transfer cases as defined in this section. The remainder of the section defines transfers and discusses under what circumstances these cases may or may not be important.\n\n\nFor the purposes of these cohorts, transfers are defined by identifying two consecutive (sorted by \nbene_id\n and index diagnosis date) MedPAR records which have an end and start date that is 1 day apart or less. There is no attempt to separate the cases where an individual is transferred within a hospital as opposed to a new hospital, although it is possible to do this using the provider number. Furthermore, we do not attempt to track the source of the hospital admission (e.g. did the patient come from another hospital versus an emergency room). It is possible to extend our loose definition of a transfer to include some of these other factors, but we chose not to \n14\n.\n\n\nUpon closer inspection of the patterns three potential transfer scenarios emerged. These scenarios are presented next and relevant information is discussed in the remainder of this section:\n\n\n\n\nPatient has \nhospital stay with an AMI, and then is transferred\n within the hospital or to a separate hospital for further treatment of an AMI.\n\n\nPatient has an \ninitial hospital stay with a non-AMI condition\n. The patient is transferred and is coded with a principal diagnosis of an AMI.\n\n\nPatient has an \ninitial hospital stay with an AMI and is discharged within one day\n. The patient is transferred, either within the hospital or to a different hospital and is coded with a non-AMI principal diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\nThe following program \nFlagTransfers.sas\n found under the \n2create_index_level_measures\n folder adds the transfer scenario flags for the MedPAR claims files. Run the program after extracting the MedPAR claim (running all of the programs in 1 folder set. To run the program, assign the code parameter to the first 3 digits of your diagnostic codes used to define the index event. For more thorough examples, the ACS example has been hard coded into the data.\n\n\nThe program goes through and flags the data rather than imposing any assumptions on the data about what is generating the pattern of stays. The corresponding flags in the data are \nflagScen1\n, \nflagScen2\n and \nflagScen3\n. Each scenario is further discussed below.\n\n\nAlthough the code controls for the first scenario, it is worth discussing because it highlights how specific assumptions imposed at the beginning of the code can interact with different exclusion criteria. The current algorithm controls for this scenario when the restrictions are imposed on the candidate index events by the program \n1B_impose_restrictions.sas\n. The program sorts the index events so that the procedure chooses the first index event and drops all other index events that occur within a year, in addition to some other exclusion restrictions. However, the case for an AMI is slightly different because index events which occur at SNFs in data step 2 are excluded from being a candidate index event. As a result in a very small amount of cases, the procedure fails to choose the first index event due to the exclusion of SNF encounters as potential AMI index events. To reiterate, scenario 1 should not cause any problems in most cases, although one should take care to test how additional restrictions impact the algorithm, especially if those restrictions are imposed in the beginning of the \n1B_impose_restrictions.sas\n script.\n\n\nScenario 2 is potentially more problematic for several reasons. Conceptually, we are trying to construct a cohort of individuals who experience an AMI as a discrete medical event since results derived from such a cohort apply reasonably directly to an important set of real-world populations and situations. For this reason, we have not previously sought to include AMIs that occur as complications during non-AMI hospitalizations\n15\n. There is also a practical difficulty. If we are not comfortable assuming that the transfer to the second stay happens immediately upon the onset of the AMI, then dating the beginning of the AMI episode and tallying the costs associated with treating the episode becomes difficult. Specifically, some indeterminate portion of the initial hospital stay should be considered \u201cpart of the episode,\u201d but the data provide no way of making that split.\n\n\nWhile it is plausible to view scenario 2 as describing an AMI occurring as part of a complication from some other long hospital stay, scenario 2 could just as easily be describing an instance where an individual first goes to a hospital for chest pains, then is transferred because of an AMI. In these instances, it is difficult to argue against including these index events. The code keeps both stays described in scenario 2. The stay which references an AMI is defined as an index event and both stays can be found on the claims file outputted from the MedPAR files.\n\n\nScenario 3, is also potentially problematic because it could describe a type of a rule out scenario which the NCHS coding guidelines describe as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIf the diagnosis documented at the time of discharge is qualified as \u2018probable', \u2018suspected', \u2018likely', \u2018questionable', \u2018possible', or \u2018still to be ruled out', code the condition as if it existed. The basis for this guideline is that diagnostic workup, arrangements for further workup or observation, and initial therapeutic approach correspond most closely with an established diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\nThe rule out type explanation for scenario 3 is characterized by a short hospital stay, with admission and discharge dates within a day of each other. In addition, after the individual is transferred they are coded with a different principal diagnosis, suggesting a possible rule out type scenario. While it is possible to describe a rule out type scenario, it is also just as possible that these transfers may indicate an individual who was treated for an AMI and then transferred (possibly within the hospital) for post-treatment therapy. Therefore we simply flag these cases and note their existence to the reader as both explanations seem equally plausible. The code keeps both stays described in scenario 3. The stay which references an AMI is defined as an index event and both stays can be found on the claims file created from the MedPAR files.\n\n\nOther strategies exist for dealing with transfers. For example \nKrumholtz et al. (2007)\n designed a risk adjustment strategy for CMS in response for legislation which called for more publicly available hospital quality measures. The results of which are reported at the government run \nQualityNet.org\n. The documentation is provided on the website, the SAS code which runs these risk adjustments can be requested by emailing \nmortalitymeasures@mathematica-mpr.com\n. Also see the following paper for the role of transfers in the case of AMIs:\n\n\n\n\nIwashyna TJ, Kahn JM, Hayward R a, Nallamothu BK. Interhospital transfers among Medicare beneficiaries admitted for acute myocardial infarction at nonrevascularization hospitals. Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2010;3(5):468\u201375. doi:10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.110.957993.recent\n\n\n\n\nCharges versus payments\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn general, the claims files contain two types of information on treatment costs:\n\n\n\n\nThe provider's stated charges for the services provided; and\n\n\nthe amount Medicare is actually willing to pay for the services (including any beneficiary cost-sharing or third-party payments).\n\n\n\n\nProviding a detailed evaluation of the uses of these two measures of treatment costs is beyond the scope of this documentation. Be aware, however, that the code described herein extracts payment variables, but, with a few exceptions, does not extract charge variables. Nonetheless, modifying the code to also extract charge fields would be straightforward.\n\n\nTechnical notes\n\u00b6\n\n\nMost work with the raw claims files is best conducted using SAS. First, because Stata must hold the entire data set in memory, processing the files in Stata requires impractically large amounts of memory, leaving SAS as the only feasible option\n16\n. Moreover, NBER's collection of claims files start in SAS format, so working with them in some other format would require a time-consuming conversion. While most work generating extracts is best done in SAS, it is sometimes feasible to work with the final extracts in Stata, at least when the underlying claims files are 5 percent samples. The recommended strategy involves carrying out all data manipulations in SAS, aggregating the data into variable of interest and then running the analysis of the data in Stata.\n\n\nBased on my experience, using SAS with the x-server GUI system is both difficult to use and slow. The program I recommend using is \nEmacs with emacs-speaks-statistics (ESS)\n module. The program allows the user to set up keys which easily send SAS code to SAS in either batch or interactive mode. In addition there are several other useful aspects of ESS, like easily switching between \nlog\n, \nlst\n, and SAS files. Be aware that even the 5 percent extracts of the claims files (particularly the outpatient and physician claims files) are extremely large when decompressed. For this reason, it is often necessary to decompress one year sub file, process it, and delete it before going on to the next, rather than decompressing all years and then processing them. Having all of the files decompressed at once, even within a single year simply consumes too much disk space once extracts larger than 5 percent are used. In any case, when planning for disk space constraints, keep in mind that the decompressed files are typically 10-20 times the size of the compressed files and sometimes larger. Because of the size of these files, it is advisable to debug your code using smaller extracts (01 percent or 0001 percent).\n\n\nFinally, some care should be taken when dealing with variables defining ethnicity. \nArday (2000)\n provides a good review about how the ethnicity variables in the Medicare claims are constructed.\n\n\nIf you are a SAS novice, or even if you are experienced and debugging a program SAS may crash several times. It is important to realize that if you are writing large data sets to the SAS work library, either explicitly or implicitly, then whenever a program crashes the files get left in the /tmp directory. Since the Medicare claims files are large, it is important to clean up this directory whenever you remember and are not using SAS (otherwise it might erase files which your program is using and cause the program to crash). To delete your files simply type in \nrm \u2013r /tmp/* -f\n into the UNIX command prompt. New users to the Unix system are advised to read the \nNBER notes for users running large jobs\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe program through which Medicare enrollees obtain private insurance coverage is currently called Medicare Advantage, but has gone by several different names during the period covered by NBER's collection. See \nhere\n (BROKEN LINK) for the most recent treatment of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nResDAC publication\n (BROKEN LINK).\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEHICs do occasionally change. The ResDAC FAQ (see below) describes a number of circumstances that can lead to a change in EHIC, notably a change in SSN occurring because an individual can claim Social Security benefits based upon their own earnings or their spouse's and beneficiaries can marry multiple times which can lead to different SSN. In addition, a very small number of Medicare enrollees have EHICs based on Railroad Retirement Board identification numbers, rather than SSNs. For reasons that are unclear, it appears that many of these individuals had their EHICs change during the early 1990s.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the MedPAR files, fewer than 1 in 100,000 records include a diagnosis code with a decimal point or that appears to be missing a leading zero. The codes in the outpatient and Carrier files appear to be of similar quality.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel II codes (or National Codes) are alphanumeric codes in the A0000\u2013V9999 code range that the CMS created to classify services or supplies not found in CPT. Before 1983, there was no uniform way for health care providers to code materials and supplies for reimbursement.

            "text": "Medicare is a program in the United States that provides health insurance to individuals with disabilities, end-stage renal disease and for the majority of individuals aged 65 and over. The services which Medicare purchases are covered by three basic parts:   Part A, which primarily covers inpatient services;  Part B, which primarily covers physician and outpatient services;  Part D, which started operation in 2006 and covers some prescription drugs.   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, typically known as CMS, administers the Medicare program.  For most Medicare enrollees, claims under Part A and Part B are paid directly by Medicare, often termed traditional fee-for-service (FFS). Some Medicare enrollees, however, receive Part A and Part B coverage through private insurance companies. 1  These claims are often generically termed HMO claims but more correctly are part of the Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Full claims data are not available for these enrollees which can lead to incomplete costs statistics if beneficiary enrollment is not accounted for. For the years covered by NBER's data collection enrollment in MA plans has been between 5 and 25 percent. 2  Since selection into private plans is generally thought to be non-random, this should be kept in mind when working with the data.  When working with the claims, users are reminded that the claims' primary purpose is as a billing system which has been made available to the research community. As such, having an understanding of Medicare's structure and payment systems is important to fully understand the data. For example, it is often useful to think about the incentives in place for providers to report data. If some claims information is not tied to reimbursement it is difficult to be certain how accurately and consistently the information was reported.  One useful reference for understanding payment systems and Medicare generally is a set of issue briefs produced by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), which advises the US Congress on provider payment issues. The issue briefs are available on MedPAC's  website  under the heading \"Medicare Background.\" Also for a more in depth overview of the historical aspects of Medicare, including a brief overview of legislation, see  DeLew(2000) . In addition a brief overview of Medicare payment systems is given in a  later section .  The following subsections are meant to provide some background to the Medicare claims files, while also explaining some of the idiosyncratic features of the data. As questions arise from using the data, the following subsections should prove to be a useful reference.",

            "text": "In general, the Medicare files are organized by who is getting paid. At a very broad level the claims are split between institutional and non-institutional claims.  Non-institutional  claims are those submitted by doctors (carrier files) and durable medical equipment suppliers.  Institutional  files cover everything else (outpatient, inpatient(IP), skilled nursing facility (SNF), hospice and home health agency). CMS offers each type of claims to researchers in separate files, in addition to a beneficiary level \"denominator\" file which provides demographic and enrollment information. The following section provides a brief overview of the types of files available from CMS, their basic structure and how the files fit together.  The majority of Medicare reimbursement can be captured in the  MedPAR ,  Carrier  and  Outpatient  files, which cover the majority of Part A and Part B spending. In some instances, CMS makes more detailed files available. One example is the SNF claims which report more detailed information about SNF PPS reimbursement system, while much of the same information found in the SNF claims files can also be found in the MedPAR file. Generally, users should take some time to appreciate which claims they need to process, and should be careful to avoid using claims which share the same data.  The  MedPAR  is unlike any of the other files because it is generated by CMS from the Inpatient and SNF claims. The file aggregates the claims into stays and is generally easier to work with then the raw claims. It is worth noting that the MedPAR file will contain a complete record of all DRGs found in the inpatient payment systems because DRGs are assigned retrospectively after discharge. The MedPAR file, however, does not report physician identifiers and may constitute one reason to work with the inpatient file, nor does it have SNF RUG codes. A new user should decide whether they will need to use the MedPAR file or the inpatient and/or SNF claims. Using both file types would be redundant and result in double counting of claims. Also beginning in 2008, the MedPAR files began including all no pay Medicare Advantage(MA) plan beneficiaries in addition to FFS individuals.  Another unique file offered by CMS is the  denominator  file, which switched over to the  beneficiary service file  in 2009. The file is reported at the beneficiary level in order to report relevant demographic information (age, sex, race, and date of death) and enrollment status information for all Medicare enrollees. The date of death is interesting in its own right and is discussed in more detail  here .

            "text": "Not all patients found in the raw claims files have complete billing information because care is paid for by Medicare in two different ways:   through traditional fee-for-service (FFS) or  through a managed care component sometimes generally referred to as an HMO or Medicare Advantage (MA).   Since the Medicare claims database is an administrative data set whose function is to track billing to traditional FFS, HMOs are not required to submit their bills to CMS. Understanding this distinction is very important to defining your samples correctly.  The type of coverage a beneficiary is enrolled in will determine whether a provider bills through FFS or whether the bill is processed by a managed care organization. Making sure the correct  enrollment restrictions  are used ensures estimated statistics use a complete set of claims. The enrollment restrictions are needed because HMOs are not required to bill through their claims and therefore are not necessarily complete, if they are even billed through at all. The uncertainty surrounding what an HMO chose to report makes it very important to make sure we subset beneficiaries to those enrolled in traditional FFS and not HMO during the time period of interest. For example, if you are looking at 30-day costs after an AMI, you should at the very least make sure that your beneficiaries are enrolled in FFS in the month of the index event and 1-month after the index event date.  Enrollment information is found in the Denominator files and is reported at a monthly level. Two separate variables are used to determine whether an individual is in traditional FFS or whether a beneficiary is serviced by a managed care organization. The FFS variables ( BUYIN01 - BUYIN12 ) report whether the individual has Part A, Part B or both Part A and B. There are some responses denoting whether they fall under Medicaid (state-buyins). When we talk about traditional FFS we mean having both Part A and B coverage, regardless of whether is a state buy-in or not. The number associated with the buy-in variable denotes the month.  The second variable reports whether an individual is enrolled in an HMO, these variables are labeled  HMOIND01 - HMOIND12  where the number references the month of enrollment information ( 01  = January). Combining individuals who are in Part A and Part B and not serviced by an HMO is what is routinely referred to as traditional FFS.  In addition to the raw files a processed file has been created to aid researchers looking to enforce enrollment restrictions.

Mortality data in the claims data is found in the denominator file, which is reported annually at the patient level. The denominator files contain general person level information like gender, date of birth, enrollment, patient zip code from SSA database and date of death if they had passed.  For a very small amount of cases in the denominator file an individual is reported dead in one year but is no longer reported dead in the following year. These individuals are assumed to not have died.  There are two date of death variables found in the denominator file, one which has been validated and one which has not. It turns out the date of death variable is not always exact in part because of the way it is processed. The date of death information comes from the Social Security Administration. However, every night CMS checks its claims for people discharged as dead and it flags these people. CMS in turn sends these individuals a letter basically saying \"We think you may have died. Did you?\u201d. They do this because the date of death is used as the last date Medicare needs to provide services and they do not want to cut off services too early. As a result, in some cases where they do not have proper documentation they move the date of death to the end of the month to make sure they are not cutting of services too early.

            "text": "Each claims file (e.g. Carrier file) reports Medicare reimbursement and utilization by the type of provider being paid (i.e. Carrier file does include reimbursements made to hospitals, mostly physicians). Note that each sample (e.g. 5% ) will track the same individuals across all of the files, that is, the sampling is not done at the claim level, but rather the beneficiary level. Specifically, the 5 percent extracts contain records for all enrollees whose social security numbers have eight and ninth digits of  05 ,  20 ,  45 ,  70 , or  95 . Similarly, the 20 percent extracts contain all enrollees whose encrypted HICs have a ninth digit of  0  or  5 . Because these digits are essentially random, the resulting extracts constitute a representative sample of the Medicare population.  3  What this means is that in order to describe the complete reimbursement, for say Part B spending, users would need to combine reimbursements found in the Carrier and Outpatient file of the same sample.  A pair of examples will best help illustrate which costs the claims files cover for a sample index event. Suppose an individual is admitted into a hospital where a physician performs a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in the inpatient setting. The physician portion of costs for this initial episode of care would be found in the Carrier file and the reimbursement going to the hospital for the general care provided and use of the structure would be found in the Inpatient and MedPAR file, although using both the Inpatient and MedPAR file would be redundant.  Next assume that the patient is released to an outpatient setting where he is monitored via an EKG continuously. The Carrier file would still be billed for the physician's role in interpreting the EKG whereas the Outpatient file would contain the reimbursement for the machine and the administered EKG (assuming the physician did not do it). Note that while some procedures occur in the outpatient setting, they may be billed to the inpatient PPS, despite showing up in the outpatient claims. In these cases the reimbursement will only appear in the inpatient claims, whereas the outpatient claim will have zero reimbursement associated.  The second example consists of a patient getting a mammogram in the outpatient facility. The administration of the mammogram and the use of the machinery would be billed to the outpatient setting, whereas the interpretation of the results by the physician would be billed to the carrier file. Screening mammograms are not paid through the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) but are still found in the outpatient files. They are reimbursed based on a fee schedule. In addition, providers may qualify for other add-on payments if, for example, the provider uses computer aided detection. Next, doctor related costs, like interpreting the mammogram would be found in the Carrier files.  While these two examples attempt to clear up how to extract costs, it is important to keep in mind that these are simplified examples and that the claims may have instances where this logic is not followed, especially as one wades into the older data. The outpatient files are especially difficult to work with because they combine several different types of providers, which fall under an \"outpatient setting\" description but who are reimbursed through different systems. In addition, the outpatient providers may be forced to bundle certain payments which complicates things further. Refer to  section 6.2 .",

For example, the CCW extracts use inpatient claims files, not the MedPAR file. In addition the CCW does not place any restrictions on the data which they summarize, as the extracts associated with this documentation do. Lastly, even if you compare the raw MedPAR file count to those in the CCW, the 2008 MedPAR file includes all no-pay MA individuals and the counts will not be comparable without some further manipulation.

            "text": "In general there are two related instances where an individual's identifier may change and cause the individual to exit the sample. A beneficiary's identifier can change if the social security number (SSN) granting entitlement changes (see below for discussion), causing the individual to appear in the claims as two separate patients. As a result of a change in an SSN, the individual may disappear from the 5 or 20% samples due to sample method reliance on SSNs.  It's important to understand the beneficiary identifiers found in the data before discussing the special case of HIC switchers. A beneficiary's unique identifier, known as the enrollee's Health Insurance Claim (HIC) number, is constructed using the enrollee's SSN and a suffix indicating the enrollee's reason for Medicare eligibility. Some individuals' eligibility may change over time, resulting in a change in their HIC; or in some other instances an individual's SSN will change resulting in a change in their identifier  4 .  While individuals whose HIC has changed presents the possibility of interpreting the HICs in the claims as two separate individuals, this would only occur if the new HIC is still in the sample of interest. Although  bene_id s are able to track HIC switchers over time, the  bene_id  does not solve the issue resulting from an individual experiencing a HIC change which causes them to drop out of the sample for example. To account for this, beginning in 2006, CMS began producing an enhanced five percent sample, which keeps individuals in the sample once they have been selected from the 5% sample and a strict 5% sample which matches the sample found in the earlier years. This is useful for tracking individuals over time. A strict 5% sample can be obtained by keeping records where the  FIVEPCT  variable is  Y  from the denominator files. The extract we create uses a strict 5% sample.  Note that HICs are falling out of the sample at a rate of about 2 percent a year. This could be problematic if you decide to follow individuals over long period of time (as we do).  To reiterate the point an identifier in the claims data can change in two related ways:   A beneficiary HIC may change in some manner causing the beneficiary to appear as two distinct individuals. The new  bene_id  solves this problem.  When dealing with sample extracts smaller then the 100% files, a beneficiary whose HIC changes may drop out of the sample depending on what their new HIC is, since the sampling is dependent on the HIC number. The new  bene_id  DOES NOT solve this problem.",

This means that when merging old EHICs to the crosswalk, in a very small amount of cases, several EHICs can be mapped to a single  bene_id . When dealing with the 5% and 20% extracts, not all EHICs associated with a single  bene_id  will necessarily be in these random samples.  CMS has made available a crosswalk which maps EHICs to  bene_id s over time. The current program first creates a 5, 20, or 100% sample of the crosswalk. Sub-setting the crosswalk file saves space and also avoids merging in individuals whose EHIC changed and as a result is no longer in the strict 5% sample. Next the crosswalk is applied annually to the EHICs for data before 2006. The crosswalk is incomplete in the sense that about 10% of all EHICs do not have a corresponding  bene_id , in these cases the EHIC is used in place of the missing  bene_id .",

The official coding guidelines are published in the AHA Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM, a quarterly publication ( Iezzoni, 2003,pg 96 ).

When written formally, ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes have the format  XXX.XX  and ICD-9-CM procedure codes have the format  XX.XX , where the  X s represent digits 0-9. The codes are often referred to in the literature by listing all codes explicitly or by referring to an entire hierarchy by allowing an  X  to signify any digit. For example,  410.X1  refers to  410.71  but not  410.72 .  The claims files store these codes as strings, including any leading zeros and, almost always, excluding the decimal point  5 . Correspondingly, even though some codes may not have a full five digits (either because one of the trailing digits is not necessary or has been omitted), it is generally not difficult to determine which of a code's digits correspond to digits before the decimal.

Beginning in 2008, the MedPAR file includes a variable ( POA_IND ) which flags whether a condition was present at admission.  Outpatient claims do not have a principal diagnosis; instead they report first listed diagnosis. That is, instead of a diagnosis, outpatient claims list the diagnosis codes in the order of most to least certain.

Note  Datasets with HCPCS codes and short descriptions from 2003 to the present are freely available on the CMS website in their  Relative Value Files . In the  RVU15A.zip  file, for example, the  PPRRVU15_V1223c.csv ,  PPRRVU15_V1223c.txt , and  PPRRVU15_V1223c.xlsx  files contain an  HCPCS  variable with the code and a  DESCRIPTION  variable with the short description. These CMS files are released under the  End User Point and Click Agreement .  7   Most procedures of interest are covered by core CPT codes, rather than the \"Level II\" codes. Note that a researcher looking to study a procedure using a set of CPT, CPT-II or HCPCS codes can find the codes in the data under the HCPCS variable since HCPCS codes include the CPT, CPT-II and additional CMS codes.  Unfortunately, because the American Medical Association (AMA) retains copyright over the CPT portion of the HCPCS, there are essentially no comprehensive electronic HCPCS references.  8  However CMS freely distributes CPT short descriptions along with their  Relative Value Files , with an  End User Point and Click Agreement  stating that the documents are for organizations' internal use and not for commercial use. Similar manuals also exist for the Level II HCPCS codes, although NBER currently has no plans to acquire them. In recent years, detailed descriptions of the Level II codes are available for download from CMS  here .  Another potential source of information on HCPCS codes is the Medicare physician fee schedule, which provides short descriptions of each code. From its inception through the present, the fee schedule is available from the  Federal Register , although finding precisely where it appears and extracting the information is difficult. From 2003 through the present, the fee schedule can be downloaded in spreadsheet form from the CMS website  here .  Beginning in 2005 9  HCPCS codes are reported. According to a MedPAC report, outpatient facilities began using HCPCS codes in place of ICD-9-CM codes on July 1, 1987  10 . Examining the claims files, however, suggests that the transition from ICD-9-CM to HCPCS procedure codes was not as clean as this would suggest. Consequently, in many cases, it may be advisable to identify procedures using both sets of codes into the 1990s.  The HCPCS codes have a technical and professional component associated with each code. The professional component refers to the services provided by a physician like interpreting an x-ray or the results of a tests. Where as the technical component refers to the act of giving the test. Some HCPCS codes, like  93005 , giving an EKG, are 100% technical by the very nature of the code. Other HCPCS codes need to be paired with the HCPCS modifier codes. HCPCS codes that are tagged with modifier of  26  denotes the professional component only where as a  TC  denotes the technical component.  The importance of understanding whether an HCPCS code is a technical or professional component arises because it determines how the procedure is reimbursed. For example if you look at the AMI cohort you find that there are many instances of  71010 , a chest x-ray. According to reimbursement rule, x-rays done at a hospital have the technical component billed through the institution and the professional component billed through the carrier file (with modifier  26 ). However in cases where a x-ray was done at a physicians office, then the physician bills for both the technical and professional component of the x-ray.",

The number itself provides information on the state a provider is registered under in the first 2 digits while the last 4 digits fall into number range CMS uses to classify provider types (e.g. short-term inpatient versus SNF provider)  12 .  The last four digits generally describe the type of provider, although in a small amount of cases they have been found to be misleading. While comparing the long-term care and inpatient facilities there were some facilities which appeared to have been inpatient facilities but who were billing as a long-term care facility. Closer inspection suggested that ownership had changed and the facility had switched over to the long-term care payment system while leaving its provider number intact. Again in most of the cases the provider numbers will be correct, but there are exceptions to this rule. Researchers concerned with this can use the impact file for the different payment systems to match provider numbers to the payment system. In above example, the anomaly was discovered by comparing the impact files.  It is important to realize that institutional provider numbers can change over time with a change in ownership or if CMS decides on it. Individuals concerned about changing provider IDs can look to the provider of service (POS) file. The file contains provider centric data, including provider address and a cross reference of new and old provider IDs, although the crosswalk has not been verified. Although both the address and the crosswalk may provide some information, generally the POS file needs to be processed further because of inconsistency in the data over the years. The NBER currently holds the POS data set. For more information about the POS files check  here  or  here .  Some inpatient facilities in rural settings with less then 100 beds can apply to have special swing bed designation. The designation allows some beds in an inpatient setting to provide long-term care without establishing a separate unit which is eligible for reimbursement based on a reasonable cost bases. However, providers who bill using the swing bed designation will have a different provider number then when they bill for their regular inpatient services. Swing bed inpatient facilities are designated by provider numbers with a  U  in the 5 th  position of the 6 digit provider number or by the  spclunit  variable populated with a  U , W , Y , or  Z .",

            "text": "The types of physician identifiers available vary by year. Across all years, the vast majority of physician claims provide tax identification numbers (either SSNs or EINs). The vast majority of physician records also provide CMS-issued PIN and UPIN identifiers  13 .  Historically CMS has made a complete listing of physician identifier available. The UPIN directory was last updated Q2, 2007 available  here  and was replaced with the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System's NPI  registry . The NPI is currently available to the public and does include legacy IDs, which may include the UPIN. The NBER has generated a UPIN to NPI crosswalk from the registry available  here .  A brief overview of UPINs is described in the rest of the section. NPI are not discussed in more detail because they are new and contain no information within them. Over time there has been many inconsistencies in how UPINs were defined. [^18] To better understand the source of such inconsistencies it is useful to understand how physicians and institutions bill for services. When a physician bills for a service, they enter in their PINs, which the carrier runs through a crosswalk to assign the given PIN a UPIN. The problem is the quality of the crosswalk has varied by carrier over time generating a major source of inconsistencies.  On the other hand when a provider submits a bill headed for the institutional claims files they provide the UPIN directly. This means that the institutional files do not have the same crosswalk issue as the institutional files. For a full explanation of the process refer to the ResDAC technical document  Medicare Physician Identifiers UPINs, PINs and NPI Numbers .

            "text": "Data patterns which resemble potential hospital transfers in the MedPAR records are presented in this section under three different scenarios. The importance of these different transfer scenarios will ultimately rest on the specific question at hand. As a result these different scenarios are simply flagged in the data and left to the user to decide on how to treat them. For the four cohorts extracted (AMIs, CHF, ACS, and hip fractures) the second scenario encompasses the majority of index events flagged as potential transfers. Although this transfer scenario is the largest for AMIs and has steadily increased over time. By the end of the time series, more than 5% of the annual AMI index events are transfer cases as defined in this section. The remainder of the section defines transfers and discusses under what circumstances these cases may or may not be important.  For the purposes of these cohorts, transfers are defined by identifying two consecutive (sorted by  bene_id  and index diagnosis date) MedPAR records which have an end and start date that is 1 day apart or less. There is no attempt to separate the cases where an individual is transferred within a hospital as opposed to a new hospital, although it is possible to do this using the provider number. Furthermore, we do not attempt to track the source of the hospital admission (e.g. did the patient come from another hospital versus an emergency room). It is possible to extend our loose definition of a transfer to include some of these other factors, but we chose not to  14 .  Upon closer inspection of the patterns three potential transfer scenarios emerged. These scenarios are presented next and relevant information is discussed in the remainder of this section:   Patient has  hospital stay with an AMI, and then is transferred  within the hospital or to a separate hospital for further treatment of an AMI.  Patient has an  initial hospital stay with a non-AMI condition . The patient is transferred and is coded with a principal diagnosis of an AMI.  Patient has an  initial hospital stay with an AMI and is discharged within one day . The patient is transferred, either within the hospital or to a different hospital and is coded with a non-AMI principal diagnosis.   The following program  FlagTransfers.sas  found under the  2create_index_level_measures  folder adds the transfer scenario flags for the MedPAR claims files. Run the program after extracting the MedPAR claim (running all of the programs in 1 folder set. To run the program, assign the code parameter to the first 3 digits of your diagnostic codes used to define the index event. For more thorough examples, the ACS example has been hard coded into the data.  The program goes through and flags the data rather than imposing any assumptions on the data about what is generating the pattern of stays. The corresponding flags in the data are  flagScen1 ,  flagScen2  and  flagScen3 . Each scenario is further discussed below.  Although the code controls for the first scenario, it is worth discussing because it highlights how specific assumptions imposed at the beginning of the code can interact with different exclusion criteria. The current algorithm controls for this scenario when the restrictions are imposed on the candidate index events by the program  1B_impose_restrictions.sas . The program sorts the index events so that the procedure chooses the first index event and drops all other index events that occur within a year, in addition to some other exclusion restrictions. However, the case for an AMI is slightly different because index events which occur at SNFs in data step 2 are excluded from being a candidate index event. As a result in a very small amount of cases, the procedure fails to choose the first index event due to the exclusion of SNF encounters as potential AMI index events. To reiterate, scenario 1 should not cause any problems in most cases, although one should take care to test how additional restrictions impact the algorithm, especially if those restrictions are imposed in the beginning of the  1B_impose_restrictions.sas  script.  Scenario 2 is potentially more problematic for several reasons. Conceptually, we are trying to construct a cohort of individuals who experience an AMI as a discrete medical event since results derived from such a cohort apply reasonably directly to an important set of real-world populations and situations. For this reason, we have not previously sought to include AMIs that occur as complications during non-AMI hospitalizations 15 . There is also a practical difficulty. If we are not comfortable assuming that the transfer to the second stay happens immediately upon the onset of the AMI, then dating the beginning of the AMI episode and tallying the costs associated with treating the episode becomes difficult. Specifically, some indeterminate portion of the initial hospital stay should be considered \u201cpart of the episode,\u201d but the data provide no way of making that split.  While it is plausible to view scenario 2 as describing an AMI occurring as part of a complication from some other long hospital stay, scenario 2 could just as easily be describing an instance where an individual first goes to a hospital for chest pains, then is transferred because of an AMI. In these instances, it is difficult to argue against including these index events. The code keeps both stays described in scenario 2. The stay which references an AMI is defined as an index event and both stays can be found on the claims file outputted from the MedPAR files.  Scenario 3, is also potentially problematic because it could describe a type of a rule out scenario which the NCHS coding guidelines describe as follows:   If the diagnosis documented at the time of discharge is qualified as \u2018probable', \u2018suspected', \u2018likely', \u2018questionable', \u2018possible', or \u2018still to be ruled out', code the condition as if it existed. The basis for this guideline is that diagnostic workup, arrangements for further workup or observation, and initial therapeutic approach correspond most closely with an established diagnosis.   The rule out type explanation for scenario 3 is characterized by a short hospital stay, with admission and discharge dates within a day of each other. In addition, after the individual is transferred they are coded with a different principal diagnosis, suggesting a possible rule out type scenario. While it is possible to describe a rule out type scenario, it is also just as possible that these transfers may indicate an individual who was treated for an AMI and then transferred (possibly within the hospital) for post-treatment therapy. Therefore we simply flag these cases and note their existence to the reader as both explanations seem equally plausible. The code keeps both stays described in scenario 3. The stay which references an AMI is defined as an index event and both stays can be found on the claims file created from the MedPAR files.  Other strategies exist for dealing with transfers. For example  Krumholtz et al. (2007)  designed a risk adjustment strategy for CMS in response for legislation which called for more publicly available hospital quality measures. The results of which are reported at the government run  QualityNet.org . The documentation is provided on the website, the SAS code which runs these risk adjustments can be requested by emailing  mortalitymeasures@mathematica-mpr.com .

            "text": "Most work with the raw claims files is best conducted using SAS. First, because Stata must hold the entire data set in memory, processing the files in Stata requires impractically large amounts of memory, leaving SAS as the only feasible option 16 . Moreover, NBER's collection of claims files start in SAS format, so working with them in some other format would require a time-consuming conversion. While most work generating extracts is best done in SAS, it is sometimes feasible to work with the final extracts in Stata, at least when the underlying claims files are 5 percent samples. The recommended strategy involves carrying out all data manipulations in SAS, aggregating the data into variable of interest and then running the analysis of the data in Stata.  Based on my experience, using SAS with the x-server GUI system is both difficult to use and slow. The program I recommend using is  Emacs with emacs-speaks-statistics (ESS)  module. The program allows the user to set up keys which easily send SAS code to SAS in either batch or interactive mode. In addition there are several other useful aspects of ESS, like easily switching between  log ,  lst , and SAS files. Be aware that even the 5 percent extracts of the claims files (particularly the outpatient and physician claims files) are extremely large when decompressed. For this reason, it is often necessary to decompress one year sub file, process it, and delete it before going on to the next, rather than decompressing all years and then processing them. Having all of the files decompressed at once, even within a single year simply consumes too much disk space once extracts larger than 5 percent are used. In any case, when planning for disk space constraints, keep in mind that the decompressed files are typically 10-20 times the size of the compressed files and sometimes larger. Because of the size of these files, it is advisable to debug your code using smaller extracts (01 percent or 0001 percent).  Finally, some care should be taken when dealing with variables defining ethnicity.  Arday (2000)  provides a good review about how the ethnicity variables in the Medicare claims are constructed.  If you are a SAS novice, or even if you are experienced and debugging a program SAS may crash several times. It is important to realize that if you are writing large data sets to the SAS work library, either explicitly or implicitly, then whenever a program crashes the files get left in the /tmp directory. Since the Medicare claims files are large, it is important to clean up this directory whenever you remember and are not using SAS (otherwise it might erase files which your program is using and cause the program to crash). To delete your files simply type in  rm \u2013r /tmp/* -f  into the UNIX command prompt. New users to the Unix system are advised to read the  NBER notes for users running large jobs .      The program through which Medicare enrollees obtain private insurance coverage is currently called Medicare Advantage, but has gone by several different names during the period covered by NBER's collection. See  here  (BROKEN LINK) for the most recent treatment of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans.\u00a0 \u21a9    See the  ResDAC publication  (BROKEN LINK).\u00a0 \u21a9    Link \u00a0 \u21a9    EHICs do occasionally change. The ResDAC FAQ (see below) describes a number of circumstances that can lead to a change in EHIC, notably a change in SSN occurring because an individual can claim Social Security benefits based upon their own earnings or their spouse's and beneficiaries can marry multiple times which can lead to different SSN. In addition, a very small number of Medicare enrollees have EHICs based on Railroad Retirement Board identification numbers, rather than SSNs. For reasons that are unclear, it appears that many of these individuals had their EHICs change during the early 1990s.\u00a0 \u21a9    In the MedPAR files, fewer than 1 in 100,000 records include a diagnosis code with a decimal point or that appears to be missing a leading zero. The codes in the outpatient and Carrier files appear to be of similar quality.\u00a0 \u21a9    Level II codes (or National Codes) are alphanumeric codes in the A0000\u2013V9999 code range that the CMS created to classify services or supplies not found in CPT. Before 1983, there was no uniform way for health care providers to code materials and supplies for reimbursement. Although the majority of codes needed to report services or procedures- are in the CPT coding system, CPT does not include codes for most materials or supplies; thus, many codes for materials and supplies can be found in CMS's HCPCS Level II coding system\u00a0 \u21a9    https://github.com/jackwasey/icd/issues/81#issuecomment-217017528 \u00a0 \u21a9    These manuals are also available in \"snippet view\" on Google Books.\u00a0 \u21a9    Effective July 2004, ICD-9-CM procedure codes are no longer being accepted on Outpatient claims. The ICD-9-CM code were named as the HIPAA standard code set for inpatient hospital procedures. HCPCS/CPT codes were named as the standard code set for physician services and other health care services.\u00a0 \u21a9    See  here .\u00a0 \u21a9    See the question \"Why isn't the residence information (e.g. county code) found in the Denominator file and claims files completely in agreement when I link them?\" in the  ResDAC FAQ .\u00a0 \u21a9    See  here  for basic information on the form of Medicare provider identifiers.\u00a0 \u21a9    See  here  for a description of physician PIN and UPIN identifiers.\u00a0 \u21a9    The claims data have two different variables which track the source of a hospital admission ( src_adms ) and also the discharge destination ( dstntncd ). In the sense, we can track \u201cin-transfers\u201d and \u201cout-transfers\u201d. While the claims do identify these transfers we have not validated the accuracy of these variables, particularly for some of the older claims files. They should be used with caution. Another option is to use the provider serial number to categorize where each individual comes from.\u00a0 \u21a9    It's worth noting that it is also likely to be an oddly-selected subset since the probability of transfer, conditional on an AMI, undoubtedly depends on the characteristics of hospitals A and B, as well as on the patient's characteristics.\u00a0 \u21a9    It might be possible to conduct a project using only 5 percent sample files entirely in Stata. But this approach would make it impossible to ever scale up to 20 percent or 100 percent samples if that ultimately became desirable.\u00a0 \u21a9",

Centralizing the code makes it easier for bugs to be found and fixed. It also has the added impact of flattening the learning curve for new researchers to the Medicare claim files by leveraging the work done by researchers who have come before them. Many of the programs are nearly ready to be run \"out of the box\". The following section briefly describes an overview of the SAS code, outlines important restrictions which the program places on the extracts and details the process of setting up the programs to run in SAS.\n\n\nThe extraction occurs in four general steps, with each of the folders being labeled in the order in which they should be run. For example the \n0PreProcess\n folder programs should be run before the \n1PrimaryExtractionPrgms\n. Furthermore programs which are either labeled \n1A\n, \n1B\n, or \n1C\n should be run in the order designated by the associated letter.\n\n\nThe \n/tmp\n drives, previously referred to as space drive, referenced in this section are NBER specific drives which are local to the server processing the code and helps avoid I/O constraints on the system, in effect speeding up how fast your code is processed. Note this has recently changed due to system upgrade and now the network drives are actually faster - depending on system traffic.\n\n\nAlso for a general overview to thinking about scientific computing, \nthis article\n provides a nice overview.\n\n\nThe following steps outline how to get started with the programs:\n\n\n\n\nChoose a text editor to use on the Linux servers - lots of choices\n\n\nGet comfortable with running code on the Linux servers\n\n\nDownload code or use the git clone feature if you're working on the NBER servers\n\n\nCheck to make sure that a proper DUA and user name folder has been set up for you on the space, disk and bulk drives. The following step will use these folders to create a directory structure for you.\n\n\nDefine directories in the \nset_up_directory.sas\n and \nset_up_directory.do\n. This file will create the directory structure for you\n\n\nDecide on the group of ICD-9-CM and/or HCPCS codes which will define your cohort and which claims files will be used to flag candidate index events. Put these codes in the \nicd9_chrt_definition.sas\n and/or \nhcpcs_chrt_defintion.sas\n. If you are not using the carrier or outpatient files to define your cohort or are not using the HCPCS codes, then you can ignore the \nhcpcs_chrt_defintion.sas\n files\n\n\nFill out the parameters in the shell \nprogramrunAllprgms.sh\n found under the \nTODO#\n tags. The program has been modified (April 2014) to allow users to simply define variables in this files which are then passed to SAS programs. Saves the hassle of opening and closing SAS files. Note users will still be able to run a single sas program but you will need to update the parameters. As you fill out the different variables it will be important to make sure you understand the different restrictions it passes onto the creation of the extract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nOnly run programs in \nrunAllprgms.sh\n that your DUA covers. Comment out those files you wish not to run.\n\n\n\n\nGetting comfortable with the NBER Unix systems and SAS\n\u00b6\n\n\nChoosing a text editor\n\u00b6\n\n\nChoosing a text editor is important and is worth taking some time to choose one that fits your needs the best. Some text editors currently available on the servers are EMACS, pico, and vi, and there are many others available for use on your local machine. It is recommended that you use a text editor on the server or at least a text editor which is able to read files over ssh, in order to avoid the hassle of having to copy programs from your local machine to the server. Remember that results are often sensitive and should not be held on your local machine.\n\n\nAlthough Emacs has a steep learning curve, I chose it because it is extensible and you can trust that the large user community has implemented most any feature you may want. Beside general coding ease, I have found it quite useful for writing tex files to display results and for keeping to do lists via the \norg-mode extension\n.\n\n\nEmacs is customized through an initialization file read from the home directory. The \n.emacs\n file needs to be created and placed in your home directory. A sample \n.emacs\n file is provided at \nAuxiliary/EMACSDOC\n. Note that an old copy of ESS is supplied in the same directory. In order for Emacs to successfully read your initialization file, the location of the actual lisp programs (\n*.el\n) needs to be included in the \n.emacs\n file. Yet another useful Emacs module is the M-X-cua-mode which binds the key short cuts for copy, paste, and undo to those found in the Windows environment.\n\n\nWorking with the Unix terminal\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe terminal is an extremely powerful tool. It is accessible within Stata or SAS, but you can also place a series of commands into a bash script to automate parts your program. At a minimum, new users should get comfortable with \naliases\n and checking the system load with the \ntop\n or \nuptime\n command. \nThis website\n provides a nice overview of learning to use the terminal/shell.\n\n\nFor example, the SAS pack contains a bash script created to run the SAS and Stata programs in the correct sequence and email the user in the case of a crash. The program called \nrunAllprgms.sh\n is a simple but useful example of what you can do with the terminal. To run bash programs simply type \nbash runAllprgms.sh\n into the terminal, and assuming you have assigned the right permissions it should run.\n\n\nLearning SAS and how to use SAS macros\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe programs developed to pull and harmonize the raw Medicare claims rely heavily on the SAS macro facility. SAS macros allow users to create code which takes on a series of parameters which replace keywords (\n&macro_parameter.\n) in the code prior to execution. In this way a SAS macro can be though of as a do file where a series of local variables at the top of the program are used to change the code in meaningful ways.\n\n\nIncluded in the SAS pack are SAS code snippets I have used to test different feature of SAS code. The programs are available at \nAuxiliary/codeTest\n, and may be useful to someone getting started.\n\n\nSetting up SAS programs\n\u00b6\n\n\nAssuming an individual has entered into a DUA with CMS, users need to gain access to the code, setup the directories correctly and define the type of episode interested in being studied. Each of these is reviewed in the following sub-sections.\n\n\nDownload programs\n\u00b6\n\n\nDownload the zipped file and decompress it preserving the directory structure in a target location of your choosing.\n\n\nDefine target and input directories\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce the programs have been downloaded, the directory structure the programs use needs to be configured. All directories which the programs use can be found in the following two files \nset_up_directory.sas\n and \nset_up_directory.do\n, which define the same locations for the SAS and Stata files. The two files need to be populated with the correct directories prior to running the program - many of the directories should be the same.\n\n\nThere are generally two types of directories found in these files. Input directories, which correspond to places where the programs will read data in from. In these cases, the location of these raw files simply needs to be defined. The other case, are output directories which the programs will write to. The \nset_up_directory.sas\n file will generate the directories for you as long as you define a base directory correctly.\n\n\nOnce the \nset_up_directory.sas\n and \nset_up_directory.do\n files are populated, run the SAS and/or Stata programs on the 0001% extracts just to make sure that SAS/Stata has correctly read the directories which you have defined. At the very beginning of the log file, SAS will check to make sure that the directories defined exist. Check these notes which SAS outputs to make sure that you directories are properly defined. The following code snippet provides an example of the SAS WARNING LOG that occurs with incorrectly defined directories.\n\n\nlibname tempDir \"&medtmp.\";\nWARNING: Apparent symbolic reference MEDTMP not resolved.\nNOTE: Library TEMPDIR does not exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine ICD-9-CM/HCPCS cohort of interest\n\u00b6\n\n\nAfter defining the directory structure, the next order of business involves correctly specifying your cohort. Studies using administrative claims use ICD-9-CM or HCPCS codes to define a group of individuals with a similar disease. ICD-9-CM codes come in both diagnostic and procedure types, whereas the HCPCS codes are used to define a specific procedure. The code currently has several examples embedded directly into the code. Note that folder \n1AFlagcandidateEvents\n holds a series of different programs corresponding to each claim file of interest. Each program calls in \nicd9_chrt_definition.sas\n and/or \nhcpcs_chrt_defintion.sas\n depending on what is reported in the claim. The programs use these two files to look for a cohort definition.\n\n\nOnce a series of ICD-9-CM/HCPCS codes of interest have been selected, a short bit of code needs to be placed in the relevant file. Note that in addition to choosing the ICD-9-CM code, a name stub (\nami\n in the example below) also needs to be referenced which all of the following programs will use reference the cohort. For example, the heart attack example uses \nami\n. All programs will use this stub as a parameter in the macro to correctly identify the index of interest. Future programs (e.g. \ncarrier_clm_window.sas\n) will also need to use the same exact stub name to load in the correct data sets.\n\n\nAs the following code snippet demonstrates, the new \nicd9_chrt_definition.sas\n SAS code now allows for users to define an index event through the use of a procedure code. Users for the most part should only need to change the if condition with the diagnostic code and the \nis_snf\n condition when changing to another cohort of interest.\n\n\n************************************************************;\n\n\n***  DEFINES AMI ICD9-CM CODE SEQUENCE;\n\n\n************************************************************;\n\n\n%if\n \n&cohrt.\n = ami  \n%then\n \n%do\n;\n\n***!!!!!!

In doing so it is important to understand the different restrictions used in building the cohort. Note that an index event is defined as the first episode care for a cohort, it denotes the beginning of an episode of care. The following list provides and overview of the steps in building the cohorts and the relevant restrictions.\n\n\n\n\nFlag potential (candidate) index event using the procedure/diagnostic codes defined in \nicd9_chrt_definition.sas\n and/or \nhcpcs_chrt_defintion.sas\n. The subset of patients are selected by the 1A programs\n\n\nParameter \nCOHRT\n: The \ncohrt\n variable should match the code block found in those files.\n\n\nParameters \nIP\n, \nOP\n, \nMEDPAR\n, \nCAR\n: These binary flags denote which files were used to define the index event. In the example AMI covered in this documentation only the \nMEDPAR\n parameter would be set to 1 and the others to 0.\n\n\nParamters \nIP_DXN\n, \nIP_PROC\n, ...: The parameters denote how many diagnostic or procedure codes to look through when defining an index event. For example, in our AMI cohort, as in with many cohorts, the cohort is built only of the principal diagnostic code in the MedPAR file which coincides with the first diagnostic code. In that example only the \nMED_DXN\n parameter is set to 1 with the rest of the parameters set to 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerge in enrollment information and impose enrollment restrictions (\n1B_impose_restrictions.sas\n program)\n\n\n\n\nParameter \nDAYS_BETWEEN_INDEX_EVENT\n: Number of days which must pass before an individuals can have another index event assigned. The assumption is very important because in a sense it defines how much time must pass before we want to treat a new candidate episode as a new event. It also takes care of transfers since the first index event will be assigned.\n\n\nParameters \nFFSmonthpost\n and \nFFSmonthpre\n: The individual is continuously enrolled in Parts A and B of traditional Medicare (rather than a Medicare private plan) during the twelve months before AMI and until twelve months after AMI, or until death. (months can be changed by the variables \nFFSmonthpost\n/\nFFSmonthpre\n)\n\n\nParameters \nHMOmonthpost\n and \nHMOmonthpre\n: The individual is continuously not in HMO during the twelve months before AMI and until twelve months after AMI, or until death. (months can be changed by the variables \nHMOmonthpost\n/\nHMOmonthpre\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe individual is at least 66 years of age at the time of the AMI\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis is hard coded and would need to be changed in the 1B program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo bad date of death or birthday\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis is hard coded and would need to be changed in the 1B program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPull claims around the index event dates, using the index date (first treatment date for disease/procedure of interest) which have been harmonized\n\n\n\n\nRun secondary programs to define comorbidities and cost statistics\n\n\nRaw cost statistics: \nDAY1\n - \nDAY7\n variable denote the \nX\n day cost you want to be calculated. For example setting \nDAY1=30\n, \nDAY2=90\n and \nDAY3=365\n would create 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day costs where the day references the number of days occurring after the index event date.\n\n\nParameter \nYEARIN\n: Since cost statistics combine information across claims, you need to define the earliest year of the claim you are using, it's usually the MedPAR data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to run a specific SAS program, the wrapper macro needs to be invoked with the correct set of parameters. Most of the time the parameters are very similar across the programs and is why the \nrunAllprgm.sh\n bash file was created to feed each SAS program its parameters. Note that the parameters are documented at the end of each program, with some of the most common parameters defined in the following table. The programs are generally saved with a sample wrapper program call at the end. The parameters in many cases will also define the name of the data set created or loaded up depending on the program. Therefore, it is important to use the same cohort stub in the different programs, so that the correct files are loaded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncohort1\n\n\nThese reference the ICD-9-CM codes in the code\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncohort2\n\n\nYou can add as many of these as you would like, however if you start running several (4 plus) the efficiently of the program maybe impacted\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncohortN\n\n\nDefine the total number of cohorts you are creating\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyearin\n\n\nStart year for the run\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyearout\n\n\nEnd year for the run\n\n\n\n\n\n\npct\n\n\nDefine the percent extract you are interested in using\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndflag\n\n\nSet equal to one if you want to delete raw files as you run the program\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclmDTA\n\n\nSet equal to one if you want to convert the all files into a Stata format (DTA), as long as stat transfer is on the server you are running\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncrashStart\n\n\nIf program crashed, set equal to the year program crashed and it will restart from that year and aggregate the program once finished processing from the yearin to yearout dates. (Carrier and Outpatient extract files only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwin\n (year)\n\n\nDefine the window around the index event the program is to extract (in years). Note when changing this you may also be interested in changing the window which determines how consecutive index events get dropped. For example currently the program drops AMIs from the index events which occur within the past year. Search variable name \nlast_dgn_date\n in the \n1B_impose_restrictions.sas\n program for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubsquentDgnDayRest\n (days)\n\n\nDefines the minimum amount of time allowed to pass before a beneficiaries with more then one candidate index event can be treated as a index event. The restriction drops all candidate index events which are within \nXX\n days of each other and it keeps the first one. The restriction is important because it helps ensure that no two index events in the final data set are directly related, through a transfer or something similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHMOmonth[pre/post]\n (months)\n\n\nDefines the number of months of continuous HMO enrollment need before and after the index event month, including the month of the index event, used to restrict the sample;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFFSmonth[pre/post]\n (months)\n\n\nDefines the number of months of continuous FFS enrollment need before and after the index event month, including the month of the index event, used to restrict the sample;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case that either the carrier or outpatient extraction programs are run and they crash, it is easy to restart the programs from the most recent year which they were running. Refer to the \ncrashStart\n parameters. For example if you are running a carrier extract between 2000 and 2008 and the program crashes on 2002. First you would create a copy of your log file and save it some where else. Next simply run the following wrapper call from within the Carrier extraction program found at the end of the program.\n\n\n%RunCarExtraction\n(pct=\n05\n,\n                  cohrt1=ami,\n                  cohrtN=\n1\n,\n                  yearin=\n2000\n,yearout=\n2008\n,crashStart=\n2002\n,\n                  win=\n1\n,\n                  clmDTA=\n1\n\n                  );\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram sequencing\n\u00b6\n\n\nAs noted above, some programs are dependent on the data created by other programs. In particular, the files in the \n1cohort_extraction\n folder should be run first. The exact sequencing is given in the following outline. Any of the programs found in the folder \n1A_flag_candidate_evnt\n (bullet point 2a below) should be run before the programs found in \n1C_pull_claims\n (bullet point 2b below). \n1B_impose_restrictions.sas\n should be run before 2b \nop_clm_window.sas\n and any of the programs in \n2create_index_level_measures\n should be run before any of the programs found in \n3merge_cohort_level_data\n.\n\n\nAll programs rely on the \nset_up_directory.sas\n and \nset_up_directory.do\n files to define the directory structure used throughout the project. In addition the sequencing of programs is important and follows the hierarchy found below. Conversely, the \nrunAllprgms.sh\n bash script can be used to call all programs in the correct order after the macros in each program have been correctly been populated.\n\n\n\n\n0pre_process\n\n\nIndividuals working on the NBER servers do not need to worry about running these programs. They have been run and the preprocessed datasets are held on the servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarmonization of the raw data (three sub steps)(folder:\n1cohort_extraction\n)\n\n\n1A_flag_candidate_evnt\n: the programs found here loop through the raw data and pull beneficiaries which match the criteria defined in the \nicd9_chrt_definition.sas\n and/or \nhcpcs_chrt_defintion.sas\n.\n\n\n1B_impose_restrictions.sas\n: The single file is run after all the candidates have been flagged and saved in a separate folder. Beside the initial flagging of beneficiaries, all of the restrictions used to define the final index events are imposed in this file. The program merges all candidates, imposes restriction and defines index events with relevant demographic variables generated.\n\n\n1C_pull_claims\n: The programs found in this files pull a relevant window around the index claims. This final dataset contains all the harmonized claims for each of the different claims files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the harmonized raw files, programs in this folder build index event level measures like 30-day costs or comorbidity profiles. (folder:\n2create_index_level_measures\n) These programs use output from the previous step to create variables which aggregate measures to the index event level.\n\n\nThe final program attempts to build a final analysis file for you which is a the index event level. It merges in datasets onto the index event level. (folder:\n3merge_cohort_level_data\n). This is a good folder-file to get comfortable with.\n\n\n\n\nRunning the SAS program on the Linux servers\n\u00b6\n\n\nRunning the SAS extraction programs on the Linux servers are fairly straightforward, however there are some additional options which should be used due to the length of time it take to run the programs.\n\n\nMany of the extraction programs can run for several days due to the size of the extracts. Using the \nnohup\n command on the UNIX servers is important when running these programs because it will continue running the program even if you log off or are disconnected from the server. For example, running the following from the terminal\n\n\nnohup sas carrier_clm_window.sas &\n\n\n\n\n\nwould run the \ncarrier_clm_window.sas\n program in the background until it crashes or finishes running, even if you log off the servers. The ampersand informs the servers to run the program in the background. The program will only stop if it finishes or reaches an error which forces it to crash.\n\n\nIn order to avoid running out of space in the work directory, SAS allows you to set the work directory. Generally the SAS work directory is used when any data set in the code is referred to without a directory or explicitly with the directory work.data set. The work directory is written by default to the \n/tmp\n directory of the current server. However users can easily overrun the \n/tmp\n directory and cause all programs using the \n/tmp\n to crash on the current server (not just their program).\n\n\nThis problem is easily avoided by by invoking SAS with the additional options from the terminal as follows. As a rule of thumb, you only need to worry about setting the work directory if you are encountering problems with space in the \n/tmp\n drives. Note that most users need not do this unless their programs are crashing due to \n/tmp\n space.\n\n\nNote that all the programs have been sequenced for you already and you could just run the \nrunAllprgms.sh\n script after setting up by typing \nbash runAllprgms.sh\n from the terminal.\n\n\nInvoke SAS from terminal with separate user defined work directory - \nNot Suggested\n:\n\n\nnohup sas -work INSERT/DIRECTORY/HERE carrier_clm_window.sas &\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors impacting run times\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are two main factors a user has control over that directly impact the run times. A user can determine which server to run their program on; making sure a server is not overloaded will increase the speed of your (and everyone else's!) programs. Being aware of which disks you are writing to can have drastic improvements to speed. The programs optimize this for NBER users.\n\n\nIt is important to check the system load before starting a SAS program, as overloading a machine will slow the processing of all the jobs to a crawl. Therefore it is best to check back later and submit the jobs once the server load is reduced. Checking the server load can be done from the terminal by using the \nuptime\n command, which prints out several pieces of information. The last three numbers give system load average for the last minute, 5 minutes and 15 minutes. A number over 3 represents a machine that is loaded. For example:\n\n\n> uptime\n 16:28:45 up 75 days,  1:51,  2 users,  load average: 0.15, 0.05, 0.14\n\n\n\n\n\nServer load is something which most users will not directly have control over as it depends what other people are running. By contrast, deciding which disks to write to is something which a new user will have direct control over and which also will greatly impact the speed of the program. For example, when decompressing files it is best to write the decompressed file to a local directory (i.e. space drive). Note that writing to a local directory can cut processing times in half.\n\n\nMinor data extraction inconsistencies\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere is the possibility that some inconsistencies occur in the extracted data due to the restrictions placed on the code. The percent of claims impacted are very small, but in the event that an individual attempts to benchmark a specific measure, like number of unique claims, some inconsistencies may occur. For these reasons the following section describes when we may expect claims to be duplicated in the extraction process.\n\n\nPossible claim duplication\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe possibility for claims to be duplicated in the extracted data exists because of the way in which claims are pulled. The extraction program goes through and identifies an index event and then pulls a one-year window of claims around the index event. Due to the procedure, the possibility for a claim to be duplicated exists in the event that an individual has more than one potential index event which occurred more than a year apart but not greater than two years.\n\n\nIndex events within a year of each other for a specific individual are dropped from the sample, leaving the first index event occurrence in the final data set. This leaves individuals with an index event occurring more than 1 year apart in the sample. However since the procedure take a 1-year window, around each index event, some duplication of claims maybe introduced. The same is true for individuals pulling claims greater then a 1-year window.\n\n\nNote that this occurs for an extremely small part of the sample, something on the order of 0.001%.\n\n\nEHIC switchers enrollment information\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn some cases a \nbene_id\n associated with more than one EHIC may have two separate EHIC entries in the denominator files. A subset of these \nbene_id\ns may report different enrollment information on the separate EHICs associated with a single \nbene_id\n, although they should be the same. The most recent enrollment observation from the file is kept since it is unclear how to treat these cases.\n\n\nEstimating run times\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to help aid researchers in planning for projects and optimizing their run times, the following tables provide approximate run times for each program. Note that the \nop_clm_window.sas\n and \ncarrier_clm_window.sas\n program can be run at the same time as long as they are started about 15 minutes or so apart. The first macro they both call uses the \nindx\n dataset output from the 1B program. If you are experiencing much different run times and the servers are not over loaded, then there is likely an issue with how you have set up the directories. A first good check is to make sure you are utilizing the local \nagesasscratch#\n disks for as much of the writing as possible. This can speed processing times by a factor of two easily.

In addition, the crosswalk notes the max length of the variable, whether the variable is defined as a number or character and whether or not the variable was generated. A series of SAS macros take the information held within these crosswalks and generate a harmonized data set.\n\n\nLooking at the \n.lst\n file for any extraction program prints out the crosswalk which has the convenience of providing the exact crosswalk used for the current program.\n\n\nUsing text file crosswalk has the added convenience that adding a new file to the extracts is extremely easy as long as the variable is not changing from numeric to character or vice versa during the time period. Even in this latter case the process is simple although a bit more involved. Assuming that the variable stays the same type throughout the time period of interest simply add a row to the crosswalk file and the program will generate the new file for you.

To begin with Git is a distributed revision control system which is similar to SVN with the exception that it is distributed. This basically means that each instance of Git pulls the entire code history which allows users to easily look at the entire history of change made to a file by typing in \ngit log -p direc/filename.here\n. The power of Git is in the fact that it allows you to easily share/compare code with other users and easily created branches to your code to test certain features and avoid messing with working code. To begin with you can always type \ngit log\n to see the most recent commit and version of the code you are using.",

It also has the added impact of flattening the learning curve for new researchers to the Medicare claim files by leveraging the work done by researchers who have come before them. Many of the programs are nearly ready to be run \"out of the box\". The following section briefly describes an overview of the SAS code, outlines important restrictions which the program places on the extracts and details the process of setting up the programs to run in SAS.  The extraction occurs in four general steps, with each of the folders being labeled in the order in which they should be run. For example the  0PreProcess  folder programs should be run before the  1PrimaryExtractionPrgms . Furthermore programs which are either labeled  1A ,  1B , or  1C  should be run in the order designated by the associated letter.  The  /tmp  drives, previously referred to as space drive, referenced in this section are NBER specific drives which are local to the server processing the code and helps avoid I/O constraints on the system, in effect speeding up how fast your code is processed. Note this has recently changed due to system upgrade and now the network drives are actually faster - depending on system traffic.  Also for a general overview to thinking about scientific computing,  this article  provides a nice overview.  The following steps outline how to get started with the programs:   Choose a text editor to use on the Linux servers - lots of choices  Get comfortable with running code on the Linux servers  Download code or use the git clone feature if you're working on the NBER servers  Check to make sure that a proper DUA and user name folder has been set up for you on the space, disk and bulk drives. The following step will use these folders to create a directory structure for you.  Define directories in the  set_up_directory.sas  and  set_up_directory.do . This file will create the directory structure for you  Decide on the group of ICD-9-CM and/or HCPCS codes which will define your cohort and which claims files will be used to flag candidate index events. Put these codes in the  icd9_chrt_definition.sas  and/or  hcpcs_chrt_defintion.sas . If you are not using the carrier or outpatient files to define your cohort or are not using the HCPCS codes, then you can ignore the  hcpcs_chrt_defintion.sas  files  Fill out the parameters in the shell  programrunAllprgms.sh  found under the  TODO#  tags. The program has been modified (April 2014) to allow users to simply define variables in this files which are then passed to SAS programs. Saves the hassle of opening and closing SAS files. Note users will still be able to run a single sas program but you will need to update the parameters. As you fill out the different variables it will be important to make sure you understand the different restrictions it passes onto the creation of the extract.

Some text editors currently available on the servers are EMACS, pico, and vi, and there are many others available for use on your local machine. It is recommended that you use a text editor on the server or at least a text editor which is able to read files over ssh, in order to avoid the hassle of having to copy programs from your local machine to the server. Remember that results are often sensitive and should not be held on your local machine.  Although Emacs has a steep learning curve, I chose it because it is extensible and you can trust that the large user community has implemented most any feature you may want. Beside general coding ease, I have found it quite useful for writing tex files to display results and for keeping to do lists via the  org-mode extension .  Emacs is customized through an initialization file read from the home directory. The  .emacs  file needs to be created and placed in your home directory. A sample  .emacs  file is provided at  Auxiliary/EMACSDOC . Note that an old copy of ESS is supplied in the same directory. In order for Emacs to successfully read your initialization file, the location of the actual lisp programs ( *.el ) needs to be included in the  .emacs  file. Yet another useful Emacs module is the M-X-cua-mode which binds the key short cuts for copy, paste, and undo to those found in the Windows environment.",

The two files need to be populated with the correct directories prior to running the program - many of the directories should be the same.  There are generally two types of directories found in these files. Input directories, which correspond to places where the programs will read data in from. In these cases, the location of these raw files simply needs to be defined. The other case, are output directories which the programs will write to. The  set_up_directory.sas  file will generate the directories for you as long as you define a base directory correctly.

Studies using administrative claims use ICD-9-CM or HCPCS codes to define a group of individuals with a similar disease. ICD-9-CM codes come in both diagnostic and procedure types, whereas the HCPCS codes are used to define a specific procedure. The code currently has several examples embedded directly into the code. Note that folder  1AFlagcandidateEvents  holds a series of different programs corresponding to each claim file of interest. Each program calls in  icd9_chrt_definition.sas  and/or  hcpcs_chrt_defintion.sas  depending on what is reported in the claim. The programs use these two files to look for a cohort definition.  Once a series of ICD-9-CM/HCPCS codes of interest have been selected, a short bit of code needs to be placed in the relevant file. Note that in addition to choosing the ICD-9-CM code, a name stub ( ami  in the example below) also needs to be referenced which all of the following programs will use reference the cohort. For example, the heart attack example uses  ami . All programs will use this stub as a parameter in the macro to correctly identify the index of interest. Future programs (e.g.  carrier_clm_window.sas ) will also need to use the same exact stub name to load in the correct data sets.  As the following code snippet demonstrates, the new  icd9_chrt_definition.sas  SAS code now allows for users to define an index event through the use of a procedure code.

In doing so it is important to understand the different restrictions used in building the cohort. Note that an index event is defined as the first episode care for a cohort, it denotes the beginning of an episode of care. The following list provides and overview of the steps in building the cohorts and the relevant restrictions.   Flag potential (candidate) index event using the procedure/diagnostic codes defined in  icd9_chrt_definition.sas  and/or  hcpcs_chrt_defintion.sas . The subset of patients are selected by the 1A programs  Parameter  COHRT : The  cohrt  variable should match the code block found in those files.  Parameters  IP ,  OP ,  MEDPAR ,  CAR : These binary flags denote which files were used to define the index event. In the example AMI covered in this documentation only the  MEDPAR  parameter would be set to 1 and the others to 0.  Paramters  IP_DXN ,  IP_PROC , ...: The parameters denote how many diagnostic or procedure codes to look through when defining an index event. For example, in our AMI cohort, as in with many cohorts, the cohort is built only of the principal diagnostic code in the MedPAR file which coincides with the first diagnostic code. In that example only the  MED_DXN  parameter is set to 1 with the rest of the parameters set to 0.     Merge in enrollment information and impose enrollment restrictions ( 1B_impose_restrictions.sas  program)   Parameter  DAYS_BETWEEN_INDEX_EVENT : Number of days which must pass before an individuals can have another index event assigned. The assumption is very important because in a sense it defines how much time must pass before we want to treat a new candidate episode as a new event. It also takes care of transfers since the first index event will be assigned.  Parameters  FFSmonthpost  and  FFSmonthpre : The individual is continuously enrolled in Parts A and B of traditional Medicare (rather than a Medicare private plan) during the twelve months before AMI and until twelve months after AMI, or until death. (months can be changed by the variables  FFSmonthpost / FFSmonthpre )  Parameters  HMOmonthpost  and  HMOmonthpre : The individual is continuously not in HMO during the twelve months before AMI and until twelve months after AMI, or until death. (months can be changed by the variables  HMOmonthpost / HMOmonthpre )   The individual is at least 66 years of age at the time of the AMI   Note  This is hard coded and would need to be changed in the 1B program.     No bad date of death or birthday   Note  This is hard coded and would need to be changed in the 1B program.       Pull claims around the index event dates, using the index date (first treatment date for disease/procedure of interest) which have been harmonized   Run secondary programs to define comorbidities and cost statistics  Raw cost statistics:  DAY1  -  DAY7  variable denote the  X  day cost you want to be calculated. For example setting  DAY1=30 ,  DAY2=90  and  DAY3=365  would create 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day costs where the day references the number of days occurring after the index event date.  Parameter  YEARIN : Since cost statistics combine information across claims, you need to define the earliest year of the claim you are using, it's usually the MedPAR data.     In order to run a specific SAS program, the wrapper macro needs to be invoked with the correct set of parameters. Most of the time the parameters are very similar across the programs and is why the  runAllprgm.sh  bash file was created to feed each SAS program its parameters. Note that the parameters are documented at the end of each program, with some of the most common parameters defined in the following table. The programs are generally saved with a sample wrapper program call at the end. The parameters in many cases will also define the name of the data set created or loaded up depending on the program. Therefore, it is important to use the same cohort stub in the different programs, so that the correct files are loaded.     Parameter  Description      cohort1  These reference the ICD-9-CM codes in the code    cohort2  You can add as many of these as you would like, however if you start running several (4 plus) the efficiently of the program maybe impacted    cohortN  Define the total number of cohorts you are creating    yearin  Start year for the run    yearout  End year for the run    pct  Define the percent extract you are interested in using    dflag  Set equal to one if you want to delete raw files as you run the program    clmDTA  Set equal to one if you want to convert the all files into a Stata format (DTA), as long as stat transfer is on the server you are running    crashStart  If program crashed, set equal to the year program crashed and it will restart from that year and aggregate the program once finished processing from the yearin to yearout dates. (Carrier and Outpatient extract files only)    win  (year)  Define the window around the index event the program is to extract (in years). Note when changing this you may also be interested in changing the window which determines how consecutive index events get dropped. For example currently the program drops AMIs from the index events which occur within the past year. Search variable name  last_dgn_date  in the  1B_impose_restrictions.sas  program for more info.    subsquentDgnDayRest  (days)  Defines the minimum amount of time allowed to pass before a beneficiaries with more then one candidate index event can be treated as a index event. The restriction drops all candidate index events which are within  XX  days of each other and it keeps the first one. The restriction is important because it helps ensure that no two index events in the final data set are directly related, through a transfer or something similar.    HMOmonth[pre/post]  (months)  Defines the number of months of continuous HMO enrollment need before and after the index event month, including the month of the index event, used to restrict the sample;    FFSmonth[pre/post]  (months)  Defines the number of months of continuous FFS enrollment need before and after the index event month, including the month of the index event, used to restrict the sample;     In the case that either the carrier or outpatient extraction programs are run and they crash, it is easy to restart the programs from the most recent year which they were running. Refer to the  crashStart  parameters. For example if you are running a carrier extract between 2000 and 2008 and the program crashes on 2002. First you would create a copy of your log file and save it some where else. Next simply run the following wrapper call from within the Carrier extraction program found at the end of the program.  %RunCarExtraction (pct= 05 ,\n                  cohrt1=ami,\n                  cohrtN= 1 ,\n                  yearin= 2000 ,yearout= 2008 ,crashStart= 2002 ,\n                  win= 1 ,\n                  clmDTA= 1 \n                  );",

            "text": "Running the SAS extraction programs on the Linux servers are fairly straightforward, however there are some additional options which should be used due to the length of time it take to run the programs.  Many of the extraction programs can run for several days due to the size of the extracts. Using the  nohup  command on the UNIX servers is important when running these programs because it will continue running the program even if you log off or are disconnected from the server. For example, running the following from the terminal  nohup sas carrier_clm_window.sas &  would run the  carrier_clm_window.sas  program in the background until it crashes or finishes running, even if you log off the servers. The ampersand informs the servers to run the program in the background. The program will only stop if it finishes or reaches an error which forces it to crash.  In order to avoid running out of space in the work directory, SAS allows you to set the work directory. Generally the SAS work directory is used when any data set in the code is referred to without a directory or explicitly with the directory work.data set. The work directory is written by default to the  /tmp  directory of the current server. However users can easily overrun the  /tmp  directory and cause all programs using the  /tmp  to crash on the current server (not just their program).  This problem is easily avoided by by invoking SAS with the additional options from the terminal as follows. As a rule of thumb, you only need to worry about setting the work directory if you are encountering problems with space in the  /tmp  drives. Note that most users need not do this unless their programs are crashing due to  /tmp  space.  Note that all the programs have been sequenced for you already and you could just run the  runAllprgms.sh  script after setting up by typing  bash runAllprgms.sh  from the terminal.

A user can determine which server to run their program on; making sure a server is not overloaded will increase the speed of your (and everyone else's!) programs. Being aware of which disks you are writing to can have drastic improvements to speed. The programs optimize this for NBER users.  It is important to check the system load before starting a SAS program, as overloading a machine will slow the processing of all the jobs to a crawl. Therefore it is best to check back later and submit the jobs once the server load is reduced. Checking the server load can be done from the terminal by using the  uptime  command, which prints out several pieces of information. The last three numbers give system load average for the last minute, 5 minutes and 15 minutes. A number over 3 represents a machine that is loaded. For example:  > uptime\n 16:28:45 up 75 days,  1:51,  2 users,  load average: 0.15, 0.05, 0.14  Server load is something which most users will not directly have control over as it depends what other people are running. By contrast, deciding which disks to write to is something which a new user will have direct control over and which also will greatly impact the speed of the program.

This leaves individuals with an index event occurring more than 1 year apart in the sample.

The initial cohorts are extracted from the files in SAS. Next a series of SAS programs process the original extracts until information has been sufficiently aggregated to the index level, resulting in substantially reduced file sizes. Finally the data is transferred to Stata using Stat/Transfer. Note that SAS is the recommended program for extracting the cohorts and manipulating the data. Using SAS has the benefit of allowing your code to be easily extensible to a larger extract because SAS does not have the same memory constraints as Stata.\n\n\nThe extraction programs use SAS scripts, corresponding to the MedPAR files (based on the Inpatient/SNF claims) and the Carrier, Outpatient, and denominator claims. First the onset of a disease is identified using the programs found in the folder \n1A_flag_candidate_evnt\n . Users have the option of using claims from Inpatient, Medpar, Outpatient and/or carrier files to define candidate index events. These disease events are indexed and used to pull claims from the MedPAR, Carrier and Outpatient files after a series of enrollment restrictions are place on the beneficiaries using the denominator file. Next a series of scripts provide information on (1) comorbidities, (2) costs, (3) procedures and (4) cost utilization measures .\n\n\nIn order to preserve the integrity of the SAS data files, the NBER has split the claims data into smaller compressed file parts per year. The SAS programs decompress one part at a time, manipulates it, saves the relevant observations and then deletes the original. While this type of iterative procedure saves on system resources, it can make the code difficult to follow because the program consists of a series of iterative macros defined to process one part at a time and finally combine them in a final step. Note that pre-2006 MedPAR files have not been chunked because of their relative size, where as the rest of the claims have been. Beginning in 2006 the MedPAR files will also be chunked.\n\n\nIn the case of a program crash or a partial run, the program will need to be run again. Rerunning the program in turn will cause SAS to automatically overwrite the log file, which has important information about how the data set was constructed. Care should be taken when debugging the program to make sure log files of interest are not overwritten.\n\n\nEven if you successfully run the program, and then decide to run a separate extraction program SAS will overwrite the log file in the directory you are working in. For this reason, the programs automatically create a new folder and copies the log and lst file to the folder at the end of each run after tagging them with the date, years run and cohort of interest. Note that if you are running several cohorts the log file is simply copied at the end of the cohort loop and in some cases the full log file information - including total time run - will only be present on the log file of the last cohort.\n\n\nFlagging candidate index events\n\u00b6\n\n\nFolder: \n1A_flag_candidate_evnt\n\n\nBefore running any programs a cohort needs to be defined. This means defining the combination of HCPCS and ICD9-CM codes used to define a specific variable. At the same time the choice of HCPCS or ICD9-CM codes will depend on which claims files are used to pull potential candidate index events from. In many cases individuals choose to uses the primary diagnostic code from an inpatient stay, which can be found either on the Inpatient claims or the MedPAR file.\n\n\nFor example, limiting the sample to AMIs hospitalized will ensure that the AMIs being studied demark a clean start to a new episode of care, since nearly all AMIs are hospitalized soon after onset (unless the victim dies).\n\n\nThe first step in the AMI example is to generate a sample of candidate index events, after which denominator information can be merged in with to enforce enrollment restriction of interest. Therefore for this example only the the \nmedpar_candidates.sas\n will be run. Since this program only calls the \nicd9_chrt_definition.sas\n codes, code has been included there which flags a potential AMI admission if it meets two criteria. The restriction to the principal diagnosis (first ICD9-CM code) is done in the \nmedpar_candidates.sas\n program.\n\n\n\n\nThe first ICD-9-CM diagnosis code on the MedPAR record corresponds to an initial episode of care for an AMI.\n The first diagnosis code on the record reports the primary reason for hospitalization. Since an AMI will almost always be the primary reason for hospitalization when present, AMI admissions can be readily identified using this field. ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for the initial episode of AMI care are those with the first three digits 410 and fifth digit (if present) equal to 0 or 1. However it is important to note that the code allows you to define an encounter on principal plus any number of secondary diagnoses for exploratory purposes. If secondary diagnosis codes are used to identify the index event, in addition to the principal diagnosis the parameter \n&dgnPos.\n in the wrapper macro call simply needs to be changed.\n\n\nThe admission occurred at a hospital, not a skilled nursing facility.\n This restriction is imposed because it is unlikely that an AMI would result in an initial admission to a skilled nursing facility, rather than an acute care hospital. These AMIs are flagged and dropped.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the following figure describes the role of the \ndgnPos\n and \nprcPos\n parameters in the wrapper programs. Note that carrier candidate file only allows users to define \ndrgPos\n because the HCPCS codes happen at the line items level and there is no meaningful ranking to procedures performed on the same day.\n\n\n/* dgnPos=1 \u2014 informs the programs to only flag diagnostic\n\n\n             codes in the first diagnostic position\n\n\n             (most important).

However not all candidates are usable especially if our interest is in tracking costs over time. The issue is that since, Medicare Advantage costs are not included in the claims files, patients switching in and out of FFS will have inaccurate costs. For that reason the following step performed by the \n1B_impose_restrictions.sas\n programs merges in denominator information and restricts the sample the final set of index events.\n\n\nThree data files are used to construct this part of the extract:\n\n\n\n\nDenominator file: This is an annual file that includes a record for each individual enrolled in Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B during the year. It provides demographic information, including sex, race, date of birth, and date of death (if any) and monthly data on the individual's enrollment status, including whether the individuals' benefits were provided through a private plan.\n\n\nCandidate index event file: This file is generated from the previous step. This step merges the data together and enforces a priority ranking so that index events happening on the same day are assigned to the claims file of interest.\n\n\n\n\nBefore any restrictions are place on the data, the program first merges all of the candidate index events, since it is now possible to use several files. The wrapper program for defining this has many parameters. The AMA example is given in the following figure. Note that first off since only the MedPAR file is used the the med= parameter is set to \n1\n with the rest set to \n0\n. Also the \nmed_dgnPos=\n and \nmed_prcPos=\n parameters need to match that found in the \nmedpar_candidates.sas\n program.\n\n\n%CombinecandidateIndxEvents\n(\n    cohrt      = ami,\n    pct        = \n05\n,\n    \nend\n        = \n2009\n,\n    ip         = \n0\n,\n    ip_dgnPos  = \n0\n,\n    ip_prcPos  = \n0\n,\n    med        = \n1\n,\n    med_dgnPos = \n1\n,\n    med_prcPos = \n0\n,\n    car        = \n0\n,\n    car_dgnPos = \n0\n,\n    op         = \n0\n,\n    op_dgnPos  = \n0\n,\n    op_prcPos  = \n0\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2 \nmedpar_candidates.sas\n wrapper to only flag the principal diagnosis\n\n\nThe approach used to defining the sample roughly follows Udvarhelyi et al. (1992), McClellan (1993), McClellan et al. (1994), and McClellan and Newhouse (1997)\n1\n. A major restriction is based on enforcing continuous non-HMO enrollment which accounts for a large percent of candidate index events dropping form the sample. The second most important restriction involves allowing the same individual to have more then one index event in the final index set, as long as the candidate events happened at least one year apart. Correspondingly, the procedure includes an AMI in the final sample if the following criteria are met \n2\n:\n\n\n\n\nThere is no evidence of another AMI admission in the last year. The assumption very important because it defines the amount of time which needs pass between events in order for them to be classified as separate or related. In addition, it also deals with the issue of transfers to some effect. \nControl via the \nsubsquentDgnDayRest\n in \nX\n days.\n\n\nThe individual is continuously enrolled in Parts A and B of traditional Medicare (rather than a Medicare private plan) during the twelve months before AMI and until twelve months after AMI, or until death, whichever comes first. Requiring continuous enrollment before AMI ensures that any AMI occurring during the prior year would indeed appear in the MedPAR file. Requiring continuous enrollment after AMI ensures that the claims files cover all post-AMI service utilization. This continuous enrollment requirement also implies that the earliest AMI included in the data set will be plus 1 year from the first year of the analysis. The last point will correspond to minus 1 year from the last year of data used in the analysis. Finally, note that excluding individuals who were enrolled in a Medicare private plan before or after AMI may not be innocuous. As noted above, the share of Medicare enrollees enrolled in traditional Medicare changes meaningfully over time and selection into private plans is thought to be non-random. While there is probably not a good alternative to excluding these individuals, this feature of the extract should be kept in mind during analysis. \nControl via the \ncontHMOmonth\n and \ncontFFSmonth\n parameters. Note that it enforces a \nX\n month window on each side of the index event.\n\n\nThe individual is at least 66 years of age at the time of the AMI. This restriction excludes individuals who are either: 1) currently eligible for Medicare on the basis of disability; or 2) meet the continuous Medicare enrollment requirement only because they were eligible for Medicare on the basis of disability before turning 65. This ensures that the resulting sample is basically representative of the old-age Medicare population (except for 65 year olds). \nHard coded.\n\n\n\n\nThe following code shows that in addition to defining the cohort with some combination of procedure or diagnostic codes, years of interest and percent of sample, the code also allows for users to tweak the first continuous enrollment restrictions and the days which need to pass before index events before a new index event for a patient can be defined.\n\n\n%ImposeSampleRest\n(cohrt=ami,pct=\n05\n,start=\n1999\n,\nend\n=\n2009\n,\n\n2\n                  subsquentDgnDayRest=\n365\n,\n\n3\n                  contHMOmonthpre=\n12\n,contHMOmonthpost=\n12\n,\n\n4\n                  contFFSmonthpre=\n12\n,contFFSmonthpost=\n12\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3 \nmedpar_candidates.sas\n wrapper to only flag the principal diagnosis\n\n\nThe only complication in obtaining this demographic and enrollment data is that the names and formats of variables in the denominator file change somewhat over time and differ from those in the enrollment file. The file \nConformDenom.sas\n contains the macro used to convert the denominator files into a common format. The differences between the format of the denominator files are handled directly in \nCreatePopDenominatorFile.sas\n. Running this program once for the entire population is recommended for users constructing a Medicare repository.\n\n\nThe exact portion of the code which enforces these restrictions in the code can be found in the following figure. Note that the data set with these flags created but without dropping any variables is available in the data set created by the \n1B_ImposeDenominatorRestrictions.sas\n program.

Note the observations in this data set are the same as if all MedPAR (non SNF) observations with a principal AMI ICD9-CM codes are pulled from the data set.\n\n\nami05_demo\n: Data set is unique at the individual level (\nbene_id\n). Contains information on enrollment and demographic information. Note includes information on all individuals in the final index event data set plus all individuals qualifying as an index event (observations in the \ncoref\n data set).\n\n\nami05_indxdemo\n: Data set is unique at the index event level (\ndiag_id\n). The data set merges relevant demographic information to the index even data set and formats that data further.\n\n\n\n\nThe macros have been arranged in a \"wrapper\" program, called \n%RunPrgram\n, which provides the correct sequencing and allows the macro to run several different types cohorts within a single run.\n\n\nAfter running the \n%RunPrgram\n macro, a report writing program contained in a separate SAS file, \n%CreateReports\n can be run which provides several reports, see table below. Just make sure to specify the location where the Excel reports should be written to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilename\n\n\nDescription of Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&cohrt._flagcount..xls\n\n\nTabulates number of encounters by year for each restriction flag defined (i.e. number of individuals under 65)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1 Description of report created by \n%CreateReports\n macro\n\n\nPulling harmonized claims around the index events 1C_pull_claims\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe programs found in the \n1C_pull_claims\n folder each use the final set of index events defined previously to pull a window of claims around the index event. The is basically the second pass over the claims, the first being used to define the index events. The length of the window can be set by the researcher.\n\n\nExtracting harmonized MedPAR claims\n\u00b6\n\n\nAfter the AMI index events are defined, the code makes another pass over the MedPAR files in order to obtain records for all hospital and skilled-nursing facility visits in the period around each AMI. In general, the code selects all visits that start at most one year before AMI and have discharge dates at most one year after AMI\n3\n. However, note that the user can control this via the parameter found in the wrapper macro.\n\n\nSome SNF claims indicate that the individual was still a patient at the time the claim was finalized and, correspondingly, have missing discharge dates. For these records, the record is included if the admission date and the length of stay field indicate that the services on the claim occurred within one year of AMI\n4\n.\n\n\nFinally, the extract includes any record with an admission date falling on the date of AMI. As part of this selection process, each claims record is tagged with the \ndiag_id\n for the \"AMI episode\" of which it is a part.\n\n\nNote that, as with files containing enrollment information, the MedPAR variable names and formats change significantly from year to year. The file \nConformMedPAR.sas\n contains the macro used to convert the MedPAR files to a common format.\n\n\nAfter all of the raw claims files have been processed, the MedPAR records are put \"in order\" according to admission and discharge dates. When dates do not permit an unambiguous ordering of the records (e.g. when an individual is admitted to and discharged from multiple hospitals on the same day), the script uses other information on the record, notably admission and discharge status codes, to determine the order in which the various hospital admissions occurred.\n\n\nThe script uses Stat/Transfer to export the files to Stata, however the additional code is included in the Auxiliary folder which uses SAS XPT files. The preferred method is StatTransfer as it makes use of less disk space and avoids an extra Stata import step. See Step 6 in Appendix B.\n\n\n\n\nami05_medparclms\n: Data set us unique at the MedPAR claim/stay level. The data set pulls claims associated with the index events in the file \nami05_1_indx_mn_bene_id\n. Claims one year after and one year before the admission date of the index event are found in this file.\n\n\n\n\nExtracting harmonized Carrier/Physician line items\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor many projects, including the current one, it is useful to also obtain claims records for services performed by physicians and other non-institutional providers like ambulance operators and laboratories.\n\n\nEach year's Carrier file provides detailed information on each service provided, including the type of service (indicated by HCPCS codes), the date of provision, the amount of payment, and the identity of the provider. Different years' Carrier files structure this information in different ways.\n\n\nFor years 1999 and later, however, the Carrier file begins grouping individual services, or \"line items,\" together into \"claims.\" Typically, a claim consists of a group of services provided by the same physician (or other provider) during a single episode of care. How the files present claim and line item information differs by year.\n\n\nFor 1999-2001, each Carrier record continues to correspond to a single line item, but each record also contains all claim-level information for the claim of which it is a part. Most fields on the Carrier record appear only at the claim level (e.g. patient's zip code) or only at the line item level (e.g. procedure codes). But some fields appear at both the claim level and the line item level, which can make these years' files treacherous to work with. Most importantly, each record typically includes a field containing the amount paid for the current line item and another field containing the amount paid for all line items in the current claim. Extracting the claim-level payment field rather than the line item-level payment field would lead to dramatic errors.\n\n\nStarting with the 2002 Carrier file, CMS splits the Carrier file into two sub files: a \"claims\" file, which contains one record for each claim and contains all claim-level information; and a \"line items\" file, which contains one record for each line item and contains the line-item level information as well as unique identifiers that facilitate matching to the claims file. While the split means that processing for these years typically requires a merge, it does make it much clearer which fields are claim-level fields and which are line item fields.\n\n\nThe script used to process the Carrier file is called \ncarrier_clm_window.sas\n. It first loads the index events ( individual identifiers and diagnosis dates) created and saved by the \n1B_impose_restrictions.sas\n. Next, it uses that information to extract all carrier line items (i.e. individual services) with a start date at most one year before the date of AMI and an end date less than one year after AMI\n5\n. The code excludes all line items with a missing start or end date, which appears to affect only about one in every million claims. In the process of extracting the line items, it tags each one with the \ndiag_id\n for the \"AMI episode\" of which it is a part. Finally, the script writes all records to a SAS and Stata file.\n\n\ncarrier_clm_window.sas\n must handle significant differences in variable names and formats across Carrier file years. The SAS macro that handles these differences is contained in the file \nConformCarrier.sas\n.\n\n\nAs a final note, keep in mind that, because the Carrier files are extremely large, the code described above can take more than a day to run. There are significant gains to running a program which extracts several diagnosis at once because the file only needs to be unzipped once. The program allows individuals to run several cohorts by adding in different parameters. Furthermore extending the code to other diagnosis cohorts, is straightforward and needs to be coordinated with the \n1cohort_extraction\n family of scripts. Note that if you do run a multi-disease cohort run, the Carrier program needs a lot of space dedicated to it. Of course these files are temporary and could be deleted afterwards, however one must be careful before firing of the runs. Additionally, due to amount of time the script takes to run and amount of system resources needed it is possible for the program to crash. Hence the code allows the user to start from any date so that, if the code stops unexpectedly, it need not be re-run from the beginning. See the \ncrashStart\n parameter.\n\n\nThe \ncarrier_clm_window.sas\n program creates the following files, assuming a 5 percent AMI extract was run using \nbene_id\ns and the principal diagnosis only\n\n\n\n\nami05_carlnits\n: Data set us unique at the carrier line item level - each index event can have several associated claims, a single claim can have several associated line items. The data set pulls line items associated with the index events in the file \nami05_indx\n. Line items one year after and one year before the admission date of the index event are found in this file. Note that collapsing to the claim level requires collapsing by \nfileyear\n and \nclm_id\n.\n\n\n\n\nExtracting harmonized outpatient claims and revenue centers\n\u00b6\n\n\nOutpatient claim records provide summary information, including the beneficiary's EHIC or beneficiary ID (\nbene_id\n), the total amount of reimbursement, relevant ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, and the start and end dates of the claim. Each claim also includes a series of \"revenue center\" records, which provide detailed information on each service provided as part of the claim, including the revenue center (i.e. division) of the institution that provided the service, the amount reimbursed for the service.\n\n\nFor years prior to 2002, revenue center data resided directly on the main claim record. In order that each claim could report dozens of services, each claims record contains dozens of copies of each revenue center field, with the result that some years' files contain upwards of a thousand fields. Since most outpatient claims contain only a handful of individual services, the bulk of these revenue center fields are typically empty. Starting in 2002, CMS began splitting the outpatient file into a \"claims\" file, which contains the summary information for each claim, and a \"revenue center\" file, which contains one record for each revenue center. Records in the revenue center file contain a unique identifier that facilitates matching the revenue center record to the corresponding claims record. In many instances a revenue center code of \n0000\n is output which corresponds to an empty record. As the code currently exists, these are kept for consistency, however at a later time we may simply choose to get rid of these empty, observations.\n\n\nThe script \nop_clm_window.sas\n processes the outpatient files. The script first loads the list of individual identifiers and AMI dates from the file saved by the 1B sas program. Like the other files, it then selects all claims with start dates at most one year before the AMI date and end dates at most one year after the AMI date. The code drops all claims with a missing start or end date, but this restriction appears to affect virtually no outpatient records. At this point, the script tags all selected claims with the \ndiag_id\n for the \"AMI episode\" of which the claim is a part.\n\n\nNext, for those years where the revenue center information resides directly on the claims records (i.e. years before 2002), the code takes the revenue center information off of the claims record and instead saves it in a separate revenue center file where each revenue center has its own record. That is, the code reshapes all years' data so that they match the basic format of the post-2002 files. These two files can be merged using the \nfileyear\n and \nclaimindex\n fields as a (compound) unique identifier. The amount the provider charged is taken from the revenue centers and saved in the extract created. In cases where a revenue center code for the total charge exists(\n0001\n), the associated charge is simply added to those found on the claims files. In the case where a \n0001\n code does not exist, the charge for each revenue center code are summed together. On the other hand, the total amount which Medicare paid for each service is located in a variable which includes the amount reimbursed for all services on a claim (including any revenue center ). These total charge and payment amounts are kept on the extract created.\n\n\nThe extracts do not create costs/reimbursement variables from the revenue center levels despite the fact that this more granular level costs are available. Again, the costs found in the claims files due however account for all costs found in the revenue center level.\n\n\nThere are several year-specific complications that arise in generating these files. First, for 1999-2001, a single claim can stretch across multiple records if the total number of revenue center records in the claim exceeds the number of available revenue center fields in a single record. Thus, throughout, the code makes special provision for handling these records\n6\n. Finally, as with the other files, variable names and formats change from year to year. The SAS macro contained in \nConformOp.sas\n handles these differences.\n\n\nAs with the Carrier file, processing the outpatient files takes a significant amount of time. For this reason, the outpatient code, like the Carrier code, saves data at various intermediate stages. These intermediate save points often allow the script to be started mid-way through after a crash. The code is able to start at any midyear crash point, by simply adding the year to restart the run to the parameter \ncrashStart\n. That will cause the program to restart the year you indicate in \ncrashStart\n and then merge all of the results together from the original start and end years ( identified by the yearin and yearout parameters).\n\n\nThe op_clm_window.sas program creates the following files, assuming a 5 percent AMI extract was run using \nbene_id\ns and the principal diagnosis only:\n\n\n\n\nami05_opclms\n: Data set is unique at the outpatient claim level. The data set pulls OP claims associated with the index events in the file \nami05_indx\n. Claims one year after and one year before the admission date of the index event are found in this file.\n\n\nami05_oprevcntrs\n: Data set us unique at revenue center level \u2014 each index event can have several claims, a single claim can have several different revenue centers related to it. The data set pulls revenue centers associated outpatient claims from the above data set (\nopcmls\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code also includes an approach based upon Skinner, Staiger, and Fisher (2005), which aims to construct a data set of individuals having first AMIs.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo additional data-quality requirements are also imposed: 1) The individual's death date (if listed) must be after the date of the AMI admission; and 2) The individual must have a valid date of birth. These restrictions affect a very small number of individuals.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe date of discharge rather than date of admission is used to define the post-AMI period in order to ensure that AMIs that occur in the file year of the data are treated symmetrically to those in earlier years. In particular, suppose that the end of the post-AMI period was instead determined by the date of admission and consider an individual who experiences an AMI in late 2004 who is re-admitted to the hospital in late 2005. If this hospitalization were to last into 2006, it would reported in the 2006 claims file and, thus, fall outside of the set of hospitalizations observed here.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, for these records, the final extract sets the discharge date field equal to the admission date plus the length of stay (minus 1 day) since it is useful to be able to treat the discharge date as a \"claim end\" date rather than a true discharge date.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe start and end dates of carrier line items are often equal or within just a couple of days of each other. Thus, it makes relatively little difference precisely which date is used.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping together claims that stretch across multiple records requires a unique claim identifier. The ResDAC website suggests that the fields \ndaily_dt\n and \nlink_num\n together form a unique claim identifier in the 1999-2001 outpatient records. Examining the data file suggests, however, that this is not actually the case. In place of these fields, the code uses the \u201cclaim control number\u201d as a unique identifier. This field uniquely identifies claims, but also takes on a common value for all segments of the same claim.\u00a0\n\u21a9",

The initial cohorts are extracted from the files in SAS. Next a series of SAS programs process the original extracts until information has been sufficiently aggregated to the index level, resulting in substantially reduced file sizes. Finally the data is transferred to Stata using Stat/Transfer. Note that SAS is the recommended program for extracting the cohorts and manipulating the data. Using SAS has the benefit of allowing your code to be easily extensible to a larger extract because SAS does not have the same memory constraints as Stata.  The extraction programs use SAS scripts, corresponding to the MedPAR files (based on the Inpatient/SNF claims) and the Carrier, Outpatient, and denominator claims. First the onset of a disease is identified using the programs found in the folder  1A_flag_candidate_evnt  . Users have the option of using claims from Inpatient, Medpar, Outpatient and/or carrier files to define candidate index events. These disease events are indexed and used to pull claims from the MedPAR, Carrier and Outpatient files after a series of enrollment restrictions are place on the beneficiaries using the denominator file. Next a series of scripts provide information on (1) comorbidities, (2) costs, (3) procedures and (4) cost utilization measures .  In order to preserve the integrity of the SAS data files, the NBER has split the claims data into smaller compressed file parts per year. The SAS programs decompress one part at a time, manipulates it, saves the relevant observations and then deletes the original. While this type of iterative procedure saves on system resources, it can make the code difficult to follow because the program consists of a series of iterative macros defined to process one part at a time and finally combine them in a final step. Note that pre-2006 MedPAR files have not been chunked because of their relative size, where as the rest of the claims have been. Beginning in 2006 the MedPAR files will also be chunked.  In the case of a program crash or a partial run, the program will need to be run again. Rerunning the program in turn will cause SAS to automatically overwrite the log file, which has important information about how the data set was constructed. Care should be taken when debugging the program to make sure log files of interest are not overwritten.  Even if you successfully run the program, and then decide to run a separate extraction program SAS will overwrite the log file in the directory you are working in. For this reason, the programs automatically create a new folder and copies the log and lst file to the folder at the end of each run after tagging them with the date, years run and cohort of interest. Note that if you are running several cohorts the log file is simply copied at the end of the cohort loop and in some cases the full log file information - including total time run - will only be present on the log file of the last cohort.",

            "text": "Folder:  1A_flag_candidate_evnt  Before running any programs a cohort needs to be defined. This means defining the combination of HCPCS and ICD9-CM codes used to define a specific variable. At the same time the choice of HCPCS or ICD9-CM codes will depend on which claims files are used to pull potential candidate index events from. In many cases individuals choose to uses the primary diagnostic code from an inpatient stay, which can be found either on the Inpatient claims or the MedPAR file.  For example, limiting the sample to AMIs hospitalized will ensure that the AMIs being studied demark a clean start to a new episode of care, since nearly all AMIs are hospitalized soon after onset (unless the victim dies).  The first step in the AMI example is to generate a sample of candidate index events, after which denominator information can be merged in with to enforce enrollment restriction of interest. Therefore for this example only the the  medpar_candidates.sas  will be run. Since this program only calls the  icd9_chrt_definition.sas  codes, code has been included there which flags a potential AMI admission if it meets two criteria. The restriction to the principal diagnosis (first ICD9-CM code) is done in the  medpar_candidates.sas  program.   The first ICD-9-CM diagnosis code on the MedPAR record corresponds to an initial episode of care for an AMI.  The first diagnosis code on the record reports the primary reason for hospitalization. Since an AMI will almost always be the primary reason for hospitalization when present, AMI admissions can be readily identified using this field. ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for the initial episode of AMI care are those with the first three digits 410 and fifth digit (if present) equal to 0 or 1. However it is important to note that the code allows you to define an encounter on principal plus any number of secondary diagnoses for exploratory purposes. If secondary diagnosis codes are used to identify the index event, in addition to the principal diagnosis the parameter  &dgnPos.  in the wrapper macro call simply needs to be changed.  The admission occurred at a hospital, not a skilled nursing facility.  This restriction is imposed because it is unlikely that an AMI would result in an initial admission to a skilled nursing facility, rather than an acute care hospital. These AMIs are flagged and dropped.   Note that the following figure describes the role of the  dgnPos  and  prcPos  parameters in the wrapper programs.

            "text": "Program:  1B_impose_restrictions.sas  The first section describes the basic steps involved in flagging candidate index events for an AMI. However not all candidates are usable especially if our interest is in tracking costs over time. The issue is that since, Medicare Advantage costs are not included in the claims files, patients switching in and out of FFS will have inaccurate costs. For that reason the following step performed by the  1B_impose_restrictions.sas  programs merges in denominator information and restricts the sample the final set of index events.  Three data files are used to construct this part of the extract:   Denominator file: This is an annual file that includes a record for each individual enrolled in Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B during the year. It provides demographic information, including sex, race, date of birth, and date of death (if any) and monthly data on the individual's enrollment status, including whether the individuals' benefits were provided through a private plan.  Candidate index event file: This file is generated from the previous step. This step merges the data together and enforces a priority ranking so that index events happening on the same day are assigned to the claims file of interest.   Before any restrictions are place on the data, the program first merges all of the candidate index events, since it is now possible to use several files. The wrapper program for defining this has many parameters. The AMA example is given in the following figure. Note that first off since only the MedPAR file is used the the med= parameter is set to  1  with the rest set to  0 . Also the  med_dgnPos=  and  med_prcPos=  parameters need to match that found in the  medpar_candidates.sas  program.  %CombinecandidateIndxEvents (\n    cohrt      = ami,\n    pct        =  05 ,\n     end         =  2009 ,\n    ip         =  0 ,\n    ip_dgnPos  =  0 ,\n    ip_prcPos  =  0 ,\n    med        =  1 ,\n    med_dgnPos =  1 ,\n    med_prcPos =  0 ,\n    car        =  0 ,\n    car_dgnPos =  0 ,\n    op         =  0 ,\n    op_dgnPos  =  0 ,\n    op_prcPos  =  0 );  Figure 4.2  medpar_candidates.sas  wrapper to only flag the principal diagnosis  The approach used to defining the sample roughly follows Udvarhelyi et al. (1992), McClellan (1993), McClellan et al. (1994), and McClellan and Newhouse (1997) 1 . A major restriction is based on enforcing continuous non-HMO enrollment which accounts for a large percent of candidate index events dropping form the sample. The second most important restriction involves allowing the same individual to have more then one index event in the final index set, as long as the candidate events happened at least one year apart. Correspondingly, the procedure includes an AMI in the final sample if the following criteria are met  2 :   There is no evidence of another AMI admission in the last year. The assumption very important because it defines the amount of time which needs pass between events in order for them to be classified as separate or related. In addition, it also deals with the issue of transfers to some effect.  Control via the  subsquentDgnDayRest  in  X  days.  The individual is continuously enrolled in Parts A and B of traditional Medicare (rather than a Medicare private plan) during the twelve months before AMI and until twelve months after AMI, or until death, whichever comes first. Requiring continuous enrollment before AMI ensures that any AMI occurring during the prior year would indeed appear in the MedPAR file. Requiring continuous enrollment after AMI ensures that the claims files cover all post-AMI service utilization. This continuous enrollment requirement also implies that the earliest AMI included in the data set will be plus 1 year from the first year of the analysis. The last point will correspond to minus 1 year from the last year of data used in the analysis. Finally, note that excluding individuals who were enrolled in a Medicare private plan before or after AMI may not be innocuous. As noted above, the share of Medicare enrollees enrolled in traditional Medicare changes meaningfully over time and selection into private plans is thought to be non-random. While there is probably not a good alternative to excluding these individuals, this feature of the extract should be kept in mind during analysis.  Control via the  contHMOmonth  and  contFFSmonth  parameters. Note that it enforces a  X  month window on each side of the index event.  The individual is at least 66 years of age at the time of the AMI. This restriction excludes individuals who are either: 1) currently eligible for Medicare on the basis of disability; or 2) meet the continuous Medicare enrollment requirement only because they were eligible for Medicare on the basis of disability before turning 65. This ensures that the resulting sample is basically representative of the old-age Medicare population (except for 65 year olds).  Hard coded.   The following code shows that in addition to defining the cohort with some combination of procedure or diagnostic codes, years of interest and percent of sample, the code also allows for users to tweak the first continuous enrollment restrictions and the days which need to pass before index events before a new index event for a patient can be defined.  %ImposeSampleRest (cohrt=ami,pct= 05 ,start= 1999 , end = 2009 , 2                   subsquentDgnDayRest= 365 , 3                   contHMOmonthpre= 12 ,contHMOmonthpost= 12 , 4                   contFFSmonthpre= 12 ,contFFSmonthpost= 12 );  Figure 4.3  medpar_candidates.sas  wrapper to only flag the principal diagnosis  The only complication in obtaining this demographic and enrollment data is that the names and formats of variables in the denominator file change somewhat over time and differ from those in the enrollment file. The file  ConformDenom.sas  contains the macro used to convert the denominator files into a common format. The differences between the format of the denominator files are handled directly in  CreatePopDenominatorFile.sas . Running this program once for the entire population is recommended for users constructing a Medicare repository.

The data set is useful for better understanding how different restrictions impact the final sample.

In general, the code selects all visits that start at most one year before AMI and have discharge dates at most one year after AMI 3 . However, note that the user can control this via the parameter found in the wrapper macro.  Some SNF claims indicate that the individual was still a patient at the time the claim was finalized and, correspondingly, have missing discharge dates. For these records, the record is included if the admission date and the length of stay field indicate that the services on the claim occurred within one year of AMI 4 .  Finally, the extract includes any record with an admission date falling on the date of AMI. As part of this selection process, each claims record is tagged with the  diag_id  for the \"AMI episode\" of which it is a part.  Note that, as with files containing enrollment information, the MedPAR variable names and formats change significantly from year to year. The file  ConformMedPAR.sas  contains the macro used to convert the MedPAR files to a common format.  After all of the raw claims files have been processed, the MedPAR records are put \"in order\" according to admission and discharge dates. When dates do not permit an unambiguous ordering of the records (e.g. when an individual is admitted to and discharged from multiple hospitals on the same day), the script uses other information on the record, notably admission and discharge status codes, to determine the order in which the various hospital admissions occurred.  The script uses Stat/Transfer to export the files to Stata, however the additional code is included in the Auxiliary folder which uses SAS XPT files.

            "text": "For many projects, including the current one, it is useful to also obtain claims records for services performed by physicians and other non-institutional providers like ambulance operators and laboratories.  Each year's Carrier file provides detailed information on each service provided, including the type of service (indicated by HCPCS codes), the date of provision, the amount of payment, and the identity of the provider. Different years' Carrier files structure this information in different ways.  For years 1999 and later, however, the Carrier file begins grouping individual services, or \"line items,\" together into \"claims.\" Typically, a claim consists of a group of services provided by the same physician (or other provider) during a single episode of care. How the files present claim and line item information differs by year.  For 1999-2001, each Carrier record continues to correspond to a single line item, but each record also contains all claim-level information for the claim of which it is a part. Most fields on the Carrier record appear only at the claim level (e.g. patient's zip code) or only at the line item level (e.g. procedure codes). But some fields appear at both the claim level and the line item level, which can make these years' files treacherous to work with. Most importantly, each record typically includes a field containing the amount paid for the current line item and another field containing the amount paid for all line items in the current claim. Extracting the claim-level payment field rather than the line item-level payment field would lead to dramatic errors.  Starting with the 2002 Carrier file, CMS splits the Carrier file into two sub files: a \"claims\" file, which contains one record for each claim and contains all claim-level information; and a \"line items\" file, which contains one record for each line item and contains the line-item level information as well as unique identifiers that facilitate matching to the claims file. While the split means that processing for these years typically requires a merge, it does make it much clearer which fields are claim-level fields and which are line item fields.  The script used to process the Carrier file is called  carrier_clm_window.sas . It first loads the index events ( individual identifiers and diagnosis dates) created and saved by the  1B_impose_restrictions.sas . Next, it uses that information to extract all carrier line items (i.e. individual services) with a start date at most one year before the date of AMI and an end date less than one year after AMI 5 . The code excludes all line items with a missing start or end date, which appears to affect only about one in every million claims. In the process of extracting the line items, it tags each one with the  diag_id  for the \"AMI episode\" of which it is a part. Finally, the script writes all records to a SAS and Stata file.  carrier_clm_window.sas  must handle significant differences in variable names and formats across Carrier file years. The SAS macro that handles these differences is contained in the file  ConformCarrier.sas .  As a final note, keep in mind that, because the Carrier files are extremely large, the code described above can take more than a day to run. There are significant gains to running a program which extracts several diagnosis at once because the file only needs to be unzipped once. The program allows individuals to run several cohorts by adding in different parameters. Furthermore extending the code to other diagnosis cohorts, is straightforward and needs to be coordinated with the  1cohort_extraction  family of scripts. Note that if you do run a multi-disease cohort run, the Carrier program needs a lot of space dedicated to it. Of course these files are temporary and could be deleted afterwards, however one must be careful before firing of the runs. Additionally, due to amount of time the script takes to run and amount of system resources needed it is possible for the program to crash. Hence the code allows the user to start from any date so that, if the code stops unexpectedly, it need not be re-run from the beginning. See the  crashStart  parameter.  The  carrier_clm_window.sas  program creates the following files, assuming a 5 percent AMI extract was run using  bene_id s and the principal diagnosis only   ami05_carlnits : Data set us unique at the carrier line item level - each index event can have several associated claims, a single claim can have several associated line items. The data set pulls line items associated with the index events in the file  ami05_indx . Line items one year after and one year before the admission date of the index event are found in this file.

            "text": "Outpatient claim records provide summary information, including the beneficiary's EHIC or beneficiary ID ( bene_id ), the total amount of reimbursement, relevant ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, and the start and end dates of the claim. Each claim also includes a series of \"revenue center\" records, which provide detailed information on each service provided as part of the claim, including the revenue center (i.e. division) of the institution that provided the service, the amount reimbursed for the service.  For years prior to 2002, revenue center data resided directly on the main claim record. In order that each claim could report dozens of services, each claims record contains dozens of copies of each revenue center field, with the result that some years' files contain upwards of a thousand fields. Since most outpatient claims contain only a handful of individual services, the bulk of these revenue center fields are typically empty. Starting in 2002, CMS began splitting the outpatient file into a \"claims\" file, which contains the summary information for each claim, and a \"revenue center\" file, which contains one record for each revenue center. Records in the revenue center file contain a unique identifier that facilitates matching the revenue center record to the corresponding claims record. In many instances a revenue center code of  0000  is output which corresponds to an empty record. As the code currently exists, these are kept for consistency, however at a later time we may simply choose to get rid of these empty, observations.  The script  op_clm_window.sas  processes the outpatient files. The script first loads the list of individual identifiers and AMI dates from the file saved by the 1B sas program. Like the other files, it then selects all claims with start dates at most one year before the AMI date and end dates at most one year after the AMI date. The code drops all claims with a missing start or end date, but this restriction appears to affect virtually no outpatient records. At this point, the script tags all selected claims with the  diag_id  for the \"AMI episode\" of which the claim is a part.  Next, for those years where the revenue center information resides directly on the claims records (i.e. years before 2002), the code takes the revenue center information off of the claims record and instead saves it in a separate revenue center file where each revenue center has its own record. That is, the code reshapes all years' data so that they match the basic format of the post-2002 files. These two files can be merged using the  fileyear  and  claimindex  fields as a (compound) unique identifier. The amount the provider charged is taken from the revenue centers and saved in the extract created. In cases where a revenue center code for the total charge exists( 0001 ), the associated charge is simply added to those found on the claims files. In the case where a  0001  code does not exist, the charge for each revenue center code are summed together. On the other hand, the total amount which Medicare paid for each service is located in a variable which includes the amount reimbursed for all services on a claim (including any revenue center ). These total charge and payment amounts are kept on the extract created.  The extracts do not create costs/reimbursement variables from the revenue center levels despite the fact that this more granular level costs are available. Again, the costs found in the claims files due however account for all costs found in the revenue center level.  There are several year-specific complications that arise in generating these files. First, for 1999-2001, a single claim can stretch across multiple records if the total number of revenue center records in the claim exceeds the number of available revenue center fields in a single record. Thus, throughout, the code makes special provision for handling these records 6 . Finally, as with the other files, variable names and formats change from year to year. The SAS macro contained in  ConformOp.sas  handles these differences.  As with the Carrier file, processing the outpatient files takes a significant amount of time. For this reason, the outpatient code, like the Carrier code, saves data at various intermediate stages. These intermediate save points often allow the script to be started mid-way through after a crash. The code is able to start at any midyear crash point, by simply adding the year to restart the run to the parameter  crashStart . That will cause the program to restart the year you indicate in  crashStart  and then merge all of the results together from the original start and end years ( identified by the yearin and yearout parameters).  The op_clm_window.sas program creates the following files, assuming a 5 percent AMI extract was run using  bene_id s and the principal diagnosis only:   ami05_opclms : Data set is unique at the outpatient claim level. The data set pulls OP claims associated with the index events in the file  ami05_indx . Claims one year after and one year before the admission date of the index event are found in this file.  ami05_oprevcntrs : Data set us unique at revenue center level \u2014 each index event can have several claims, a single claim can have several different revenue centers related to it. The data set pulls revenue centers associated outpatient claims from the above data set ( opcmls ).       The code also includes an approach based upon Skinner, Staiger, and Fisher (2005), which aims to construct a data set of individuals having first AMIs.\u00a0 \u21a9    Two additional data-quality requirements are also imposed: 1) The individual's death date (if listed) must be after the date of the AMI admission; and 2) The individual must have a valid date of birth. These restrictions affect a very small number of individuals.\u00a0 \u21a9    The date of discharge rather than date of admission is used to define the post-AMI period in order to ensure that AMIs that occur in the file year of the data are treated symmetrically to those in earlier years. In particular, suppose that the end of the post-AMI period was instead determined by the date of admission and consider an individual who experiences an AMI in late 2004 who is re-admitted to the hospital in late 2005. If this hospitalization were to last into 2006, it would reported in the 2006 claims file and, thus, fall outside of the set of hospitalizations observed here.\u00a0 \u21a9    In addition, for these records, the final extract sets the discharge date field equal to the admission date plus the length of stay (minus 1 day) since it is useful to be able to treat the discharge date as a \"claim end\" date rather than a true discharge date.\u00a0 \u21a9    The start and end dates of carrier line items are often equal or within just a couple of days of each other. Thus, it makes relatively little difference precisely which date is used.\u00a0 \u21a9    Keeping together claims that stretch across multiple records requires a unique claim identifier. The ResDAC website suggests that the fields  daily_dt  and  link_num  together form a unique claim identifier in the 1999-2001 outpatient records. Examining the data file suggests, however, that this is not actually the case. In place of these fields, the code uses the \u201cclaim control number\u201d as a unique identifier. This field uniquely identifies claims, but also takes on a common value for all segments of the same claim.\u00a0 \u21a9",

            "text": "Manipulating the Medicare extracts in SAS\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis documentation is ported from NBER documentation \nhere\n, written by Maurice Dalton.\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce the claims associated with the index events have been extracted for a given window, there is still some processing of the data which needs to occur before it is ready for analysis. The following sections describes SAS programs which\n\n\n\n\nExtract procedures from both the part A and part B claims,\n\n\nSummarize costs for all claims and\n\n\nExtract MedPAR based comorbidities using a 1 year look back.\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying Procedures\n\u00b6\n\n\nDue to the structure of Medicare billing, when looking at procedures it is necessary to look at claims across the MedPAR, Outpatient and Carrier files. Physician services are covered under part B and in most cases are billed by physician/group practices/employers to Carriers regardless of place of service or procedure performed, however it is possible for physician services to appear in the Outpatient file. There are some other cases where physicians may bill Medicare under part A\n1\n. The following section outlines an algorithm for capturing procedures across all claims and additionally enforces several checks about the location where physicians files their claims.\n\n\nNext some issues with using the MedPAR file to identify procedures are discussed and the algorithm for identifying procedures across all claims files is presented.\n2\n Despite the the focus on AMIs, the code can easily be extended to another procedure code grouping of interest.\n\n\nRelying on the MedPAR file to identify procedure utilization has a few shortcomings. First, while identifying procedures is relatively straightforward, determining precisely when they occurred is more complicated. The MedPAR records contain a procedure date field corresponding to each procedure code field. Furthermore, McClellan (1993) indicates that even the dates that are present may be unreliable. Consequently, this script follows McClellan (1993) in simply dating procedures to the start of the hospitalization during which it was performed. While this approach should yield dates that are typically correct within a couple of days, it may be problematic for some uses of the data.\n\n\nSecond, relying solely on the MedPAR record will miss any procedures that occur outside a hospital's inpatient department. In recent years, a few percent of catheterization and PCI procedures have occurred in hospital outpatient departments, rather than inpatient departments. \n3\n\n\nAs a result, a pair of SAS scripts has been developed to address both of these problems by incorporating outpatient and physician claims data into the MedPAR data. The physician claims data are useful because, when a physician performs a surgical procedure, the physician obtains payment via a Part B physician claim. Physician claims must include the date of the procedure performed and, hence, may provide more precise information on procedure dates than MedPAR (or outpatient) records. In particular, dates are almost never missing on the physician records.\n\n\nThe script \nStep1_tagProcs.sas\n identifies all relevant procedures in the MedPAR, physician, and outpatient claims records. The program reshapes the MedPAR and outpatient claims from a wide, with 6 procedures per observation, into a long format which has one procedure code per observation. The data output from this script can have several procedure types (e.g. cath) tagged for an associated index event since the script simply takes a grouping of procedure codes and then applies a procedure tag. For example, the codes associates several type of ICD-9-CM and HCPCS procedure codes with a \"cath\" procedure. If an in individual stay has several of these associated \"cath\" codes, each separate code is tagged as a separate cath procedure in the code.\n\n\nAnother data issue arises for a very small percent of cases where there appears to be a transfer\n4\n on the date of the procedure. The result is that there are two claims with the same procedure code and date. We simply drop one of these cases.\n\n\nProcedures on the MedPAR files are identified using the same set of ICD-9-CM codes described above. Procedures in physician claims are identified using the CPT (HCPCS) codes listed in Lucas et al. (2006) as well as older CPT codes obtained by searching through old CPT manuals. As noted above, the outpatient files report both ICD-9-CM and CPT (HCPCS) procedures codes over much of the period, and neither set of codes seems to provide a comprehensive accounting of the procedures reported on the claim. Consequently, the code uses both ICD-9-CM and CPT codes to identify outpatient procedures.\n\n\nThis script uses ICD-9-CM procedures codes in the MedPAR extract to identify which individuals underwent the following four procedures (or groups of procedures):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardiac catheterization and coronary angiography.\n Catheterization and angiography are typically part of the same procedure, and precisely which code appears on a record seems to vary arbitrarily, so they are grouped together. For simplicity, the script simply refers to this category as \"cath.\" The script uses the ICD-9-CM codes used in the 2008 \nDartmouth Atlas of Health Care\n to identify this group. The script also assumes that catheterization occurred if PCI or CABG occurred, even if the record does not include an explicit code for catheterization.\n5\n With PCI, the procedure itself involves catheterization, so this is a safe assumption. In the case of CABG, some type of catheterization typically occurs in advance of or as part of the CABG procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with or without stent insertion.\n This category includes both coronary angioplasty and coronary atherectomy.\n6\n Again, the script uses the ICD-9-CM codes from the Dartmouth Atlas for details, see the NHCS ICD-9-CM conversion table referenced in Section 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCI with stent insertion.\n To identify stent insertion, the script uses two ICD-9-CM codes: 3606 and 3607.\n\n\n\n\nCoronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\n The script uses the ICD-9-CM codes from the Atlas.\n\n\n\n\nThe script \nStep2_matchProcs.sas\n takes the output of this last script and attempts to integrate the physician, MedPAR, and outpatient claims. The SAS program attempts to reconcile all the records by first implementing an exact matching scheme across all the claims. Next a fuzzy match algorithm is used to match carrier procedures which fall within claim end and start date on the institutional claims. The remaining unmatched carrier claims are discarded and any unmatched MedPAR or outpatient procedures are kept in the file.\n\n\nWhile the different sources of information match in the sizable majority of cases, there are some inconsistencies. This script generates a variety of information that allows more detailed analysis of these inconsistencies.\n\n\nCoping with the discrepancies requires understanding why they are occurring. There are a variety of possible explanations\n7\n. One possibility is that the set of ICD-9-CM or CPT codes used to identify procedures may be incomplete. Investigating this possibility is the subject of ongoing work, but direct examination of physician and inpatient claims in cases of discrepancies has not yet unearthed obvious additional codes to include. Instead, it appears that there are deficiencies in the claims record themselves.\n\n\nThe deficiencies in the underlying claims records may take a variety of forms. One possibility is that institutions or physicians sometimes fail to report all relevant procedure codes. There are, for example, many cases in which MedPAR records fail to list any procedure codes at all, even when it seems likely that some procedure occurred during the stay. Conversely, the six procedure fields on the MedPAR record sometimes fill up completely. In either case, the MedPAR record will not include all procedures that actually occurred during the stay. Similarly, it appears that physicians sometimes fail to file claims for all or part of a procedure. For example, there are a moderately large number of cases where there is MedPAR record showing a bypass surgery and a corresponding physician claim for some related procedure (e.g. heart procedure anesthesia), but no claim for the bypass itself.\n\n\nAlternatively, providers may be reporting incorrect dates. Even if both the institution and the physician reported the procedure, if one or both of them reports an incorrect date, then it will be difficult or impossible to match the procedures together.\n\n\nIt is probably impossible to perfectly reconcile to the two sets of records. However, the following set of assumptions, allow a reconciliation that is likely approximately correct:\n\n\n\n\nAll procedures reported actually occurred (with the possible exception of some bypass surgeries reported as occurring in outpatient hospital facilities). That is, in general, they are not the result of coding errors or fraud.\n\n\nBoth physicians and institutions sometimes fail to report procedures.\n\n\nAll hospital admission and discharge dates reported on MedPAR records are correct, but the procedure dates may be incorrect. (Since admission and discharge dates can factor directly into payment, this seems like a plausible assumption.)\n\n\nProcedure dates reported on physician records are correct, except when there is clear evidence to the contrary (e.g. a patient does not appear to have been hospitalized on a day when he supposedly underwent bypass surgery).\n\n\nMissing procedure dates are assigned to the claim admission date for MedPAR and outpatient cases.\n\n\n\n\nThe last portion of \nStep2_matchProcs.sas\n uses these assumptions to generate variables that indicate whether or not an individual has had a given procedure within 1, 3, 7, 30, 90, or 180 days after AMI. The script starts with the universe of physician-reported claims. It then:\n\n\n\n\nKeeps any physician-reported procedure that falls between the start and end date of a MedPAR or outpatient claim that also reports that procedure. These procedures are dated at the date reported on the physician claim. This case covers upwards of 90 percent of all procedures.\n\n\nKeeps physician-reported procedures that fall during a period when the individual was hospitalized, even if that hospitalization contains no record of the procedure. These procedures are also dated at the date reported on the physician claim.\n\n\nDrops all other physician-reported claims.\n\n\nAdds on any claims from the outpatient or MedPAR file that were not matched to a physician claim in step #1, with the exception of outpatient claims that report bypass surgery. Where possible, these claims are dated using the procedure date reported on the MedPAR or outpatient record. If this date is not present or falls outside of the period defined by the start and end date of the claim, then the procedure is dated at the start of the claim or hospitalization.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the resulting list of procedures and dates, it is then straightforward to compute which individuals have undergone which procedures at various time horizons.\n\n\nThe \nStep1_tagProcs.sas\n program creates the following files, assuming a 5 percent AMI extract was run using \nbene_id\ns and the principal diagnosis only:\n\n\n\n\nami05_carpull\n: Reshapes the claims from the carrier files, tags all procedures with relevant procedure tag\n\n\nami05_mppull\n: Reshapes the stays from the MedPAR files, tags all procedures with relevant procedure tag\n\n\nami05_oppull\n: Reshapes the claims from the OP files, tags all procedures with relevant procedure tag\n\n\nami05_oprevpull\n: Reshapes the revenue center claims from the OP files, tags all procedures with relevant procedure tag\n\n\n\n\nThe \nStep2_matchProcs.sas\n program creates the following files, assuming a 5 percent AMI extract was run using \nbene_id\ns and the principal diagnosis only:\n\n\n\n\nami05_procedures\n: Aggregates procedure information to the index level and creates index level variable indicating how many days after the index event and individual had a procedure.\n\n\n\n\nComorbidities\n\u00b6\n\n\nIt is often useful to know whether a patient experiencing an AMI has other conditions, in addition to an AMI. There are several different ways of estimating a comorbidity profile for individuals of interests. Most studies rely on claims from the year preceding the index event in order to avoid incorrectly assigning a complication of the diagnosis as a comorbidity.\n\n\nRelying on the ~15,000 ICD-9-CM codes is simply not useful from a risk-adjustment perspective because they create relatively flat comorbidity profiles, leaving little variation to risk adjust against. As a result, several disease classifications have been developed over the years to help adjust for other preexisting conditions with respect to some outcome of interest. Although many of these classifications initially were not developed for use with administrative data sets (claims), they have been used or adjusted for such settings. An example of some of the comorbidity classifications available are the Charlson, the Deyo-Klabunde and Romano adaption of the Charlson, CCS codes, the Elixhauser and CMS- Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC).\n\n\nThese groupings often create a risk adjustment index, by using subjectively assigned weights to separate diseases. In many instances the code is available, one such example is the Deyo and Romano adaptation of the Charlson index available \nhere\n.\n\n\nRisk-adjustment is an important aspect of an objective assessment of health care costs/measures, Klabunde et al. (2000) argue for the case of including part B claims in creating a more complete comorbidity profile of the cohort. The drawback to using part B claims is a result of the inaccuracy of the claims. In addition there is what is known as \"rule out\" claims, in which doctors bill for tests and time they use to \"rule out\" a diagnosis. While the included code does not experiment with using the part B claims, a new user should be aware that it is possible to use them as long as these issues are accounted for.\n\n\nThe approach followed is that of Krumholz et al.(2007) which originally made use of the CMS-HCC codes developed by Pope et al. (2004). The HCC is used by the CMS to risk adjust their reimbursements and was originally used by the government's fairly new initiative of creating objective quality risk-adjusted health measures for hospitals found \nhere\n. Full documentation of their methods, ICD-9-CM and procedure code is available on the website. In addition all the code they use can be obtained by requesting the SAS pack from the mortalitymeasures@mathematica-mpr.com.\n\n\nThe HCC aggregates the ICD-9-CM into around 800 DxGroups from which the codes are further aggregated to create the PIP-DCG Clinical Classification, which was CMS's first attempt to risk adjust Medicare payments given the data available (Pope et al.(2004). Using a different aggregation, the DxGroups are used to create the 189 clinically relevant CCs and hierarchies are imposed to create HCCs. CMS currently uses a subset of the HCCs to risk adjust Medicare payments \n8\n and originally used the full list of HCC codes to risk adjust different quality measures at \nQualityNet.org\n \n9\n.\n\n\nMore recently the Krumholz group has updated the methodology used to risk adjust the mortality measures, choosing to use the Condition Categories (CC) without the hierarchies imposed. The hierarchies were not used because they were originally developed to risk adjust expenditures, and ensure that more severe manifestations of a disease cancel the effect of less serious ones.\n10\n For studies not interested in costs, imposing these hierarchies causes a loss of information. The current code uses the CC's but also includes the HCC's hierarchies commented out and taken from CMS's risk adjustment software in case an individual is interested in using HCCs.\n\n\nUse of the CC's allows individuals to aggregate the codes further into comorbidities relevant for the issue at hand. We use the comorbidity aggregations for AMI and CHF events found in Krumholz et al.(2007). Note that the CC to ICD-9-CM crosswalk were downloaded from the \nQualityNet.org\n site by searching for ICD-9-CM to CC crosswalk. A copy of the files used are found here. The SAS program which computes the comorbidities is found here \nExtComorbidCC.sas\n and classifies the diagnosis codes using the system of CCs. A detailed description of the CC and HCC system is available from Pope et al. (2004) and the code used to risk adjust for outcomes and payment are freely available on the web.\n\n\nThe program processes MedPAR claims although it could easily be extended to deal with Part B claims as well. The program restricts itself to all hospital stays which occur prior to the index event, given the previous caveats. The program does not look to separate the case where an individual occurs twice as an index event. Cases where this does occur results in an instance where some claims occurring after the first index event but before the second index event are interpreted as comorbidities when it is possible that they may be long-term complications.\n\n\nWith that warning, the program proceeds by first transforming the data from a wide format, with ten diagnosis codes per claim, into a long form with one diagnosis per claim. Next the diagnosis codes are merged with the CC crosswalk and the CC's are aggregated into clinically relevant groups. Finally the code aggregates the information to the index level.\n\n\nThe \nExtComorbidCC.sas\n program creates the following files, assuming a five percent AMI extract was run using \nbene_id\ns and the principal diagnosis only:\n\n\n\n\nami05_medpar_cc\n: Aggregates comorbidity information to the index level and aggregates the CC codes into more general categories.

To this avail this section provides code to help individuals assign providers to HRR zones, where only provider zip codes are needed. The second section, takes this process further and provides geocoded data for many of the provider numbers found in the MedPAR data. Geocodes have been assigned through an iterative process fully described in the Appendix C\u2193. This subsection will give a general overview of the data.\n\n\nMapping provider or beneficiaries to the Dartmouth Atlas geography is done through the use of annual crosswalks available on their website which links a zip code to to an HSA or HRR. The difficulty is often in extracting the zip codes from the Medicare data at the provider or beneficiary level in order to be able to apply the crosswalk. The main difficulty is in getting the provider zip codes which are not available in the Medicare claims but are found in the provider of service files (POS). The following 2 sections cover the programs and specific difficulties in much more detail.\n\n\nFor projects interested in geocoded provider information the last section provides a brief overview of the algorithm developed to geocode the provider, along with necessary assumptions imposed. The appendix goes into full detail about the specific programs and each step.\n\n\nThe programs which generate the Dartmouth crosswalk files can be found \nhere\n and require both SAS and Stata to run.\n\n\nAssigning beneficiaries to the Dartmouth Atlas Geography\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe process of assigning beneficiaries to Dartmouth Atlas geography is done by taking the zip code for each beneficiary found in the annual denominator files and using the Dartmouth crosswalk to code in the correct geography.\n\n\nResearchers working on the NBER servers can find a file for the population of beneficiaries derived from the denominators files on the servers. These file include annual zip code and demographics along with codes for Dartmouth Atlas geography. Note that the Dartmouth Atlas does not cover foreign countries or commonwealth of the United States. There are also some case for which no zip code match is found.\n\n\nThe program which generates the files can be found at \nCreatePopDenominatorFile.sas\n\n\nAssigning providers to the Dartmouth Atlas Geography\n\u00b6\n\n\nProvider numbers uniquely identify different types of institutional providers of care (think inpatient or outpatient type setting). The type of entity associated with a provider number are embedded in the last 4 digits of the provider number. Different number ranges are assigned to different provider types, which means that institutions that change provider type correspondingly receive a new provider number. The new and old provider identifiers are cross referenced in the \nProvider of Services files\n, but the quality of such cross-references has not been verified. Lastly, the physical location associated with provider numbers are not found in the institutional files, but the addresses are found in the provider of service (POS) files and is the main source of all geographic information regarding specific providers.\n\n\nThe POS file is no exception to the quirkiness of working with the Medicare data. Visual inspection of the data identifies some conflicting information and the fact that the POS is updated in a different month relative to the Medicare claims files means that not all providers in a given year will be found in the POS file.\n\n\nThe Dartmouth Health Atlas created a provider ID to HRR crosswalk for 2005 and 2007. The problem with using this crosswalk when claims have been pooled annually into a longitudinal type extract, is that the definition of HRR to zip codes could have changed over time to account for changing population concentrations. Extracts which rely on claims prior to 2005, will need to deal with crosswalks associated with each year.\n\n\nIndividuals working with claims prior to 2005 will need to use the annual zip code to HRR crosswalk available from the Dartmouth Atlas website. The process is complicated by the fact that provider zip codes are not available from the MedPAR files and needs to be merged in from the POS file. Information about the POS is available \nhere\n.\n\n\nSeveral programs have been developed to aid in mapping Provider ID to HRRs. The NBER currently holds POS files in a un-harmonized text format which need to be imported into SAS or Stata format before using them. The process is time consuming because it requires looking up the correct variable of interests in the code book and adding them to the dictionaries. Currently a subset of the total variables are being used, although adding extra variables to the extract is straightforward.\n\n\nIn addition, the POS file is updated in a different month then the claim files which leaves the possibility that provider in some years of the claims files are not found in some years of the POS. \nimportPOS.sas\n is a program which handles many of the problems discussed here while importing the files into SAS. Once the POS file is updated, next the HRR crosswalks are stacked on top of each other and tagged with year in the \nMasterHRRCross.do\n program using HRR crosswalks downloaded from the Dartmouth Atlas web page.\n\n\nFinally the SAS program \nFixYearDifferencesBetweenMedpar.sas\n takes the provider of service files and merges it with the MedPAR file while applying a series of edits to the addresses. Merging the files with the MedPAR files allows for the correction of certain providers for which no POS observation is available in a given year due to a difference in when the survey is given/updated. Lastly this script takes the data set generated by MasterHRRCross.do and merges it with the provider zip codes to create a provider, year crosswalk to HRRs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo specific examples I have come across are the following\n\n\n\n\nSince July 2001, critical access hospitals (CAH) have had the option of submitting combined bills with physicians who perform procedure in the CAH, however physicians have the option to opt out of this and\n\n\nSome services performed by internists and residents in teaching programs may become part of the hospital reimbursement under part A.

Additional documentation can be found below at: \ninformation on physician billing\n and also at the \nCMS manual for physician billing\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outpatient records also show a handful of CABG surgeries, which is more surprising. While it is possible that these surgeries reflect coding errors, the claims typically have corresponding physician claims, suggesting that they represent real procedures. In addition, the claim start and end dates are typically a few weeks apart, which is highly atypical for outpatient claims, but consistent with the recovery period from bypass surgery.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA transfer in the sense of a separate observation in the MedPAR file, each observation is supposed to capture a hospital or SNF stay. See Section 1 for more information.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could occur because the hospital did not code all procedures performed or because there was not enough room on the MedPAR record to code all procedures.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not possible to focus solely on angioplasty since each ICD-9-CM code for angioplasty also covers atherectomy.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the explanations given below, a small number of the discrepancies arise from a purely mechanical feature of the data set. Recall that MedPAR claims are included only if the discharge date comes within one year of AMI. Consequently, a procedure conducted during a hospital stay that starts less than a year after AMI but concludes more than a year after AMI will not appear in the MedPAR extract, but may appear in the physician extract. Even after accounting for this mechanical effect, however, the bulk of the discrepancies still remain.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink\n\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code can be found on the CMS Risk Adjustment website \nhere\n.

            "text": "Due to the structure of Medicare billing, when looking at procedures it is necessary to look at claims across the MedPAR, Outpatient and Carrier files. Physician services are covered under part B and in most cases are billed by physician/group practices/employers to Carriers regardless of place of service or procedure performed, however it is possible for physician services to appear in the Outpatient file. There are some other cases where physicians may bill Medicare under part A 1 . The following section outlines an algorithm for capturing procedures across all claims and additionally enforces several checks about the location where physicians files their claims.  Next some issues with using the MedPAR file to identify procedures are discussed and the algorithm for identifying procedures across all claims files is presented. 2  Despite the the focus on AMIs, the code can easily be extended to another procedure code grouping of interest.  Relying on the MedPAR file to identify procedure utilization has a few shortcomings. First, while identifying procedures is relatively straightforward, determining precisely when they occurred is more complicated. The MedPAR records contain a procedure date field corresponding to each procedure code field. Furthermore, McClellan (1993) indicates that even the dates that are present may be unreliable. Consequently, this script follows McClellan (1993) in simply dating procedures to the start of the hospitalization during which it was performed. While this approach should yield dates that are typically correct within a couple of days, it may be problematic for some uses of the data.  Second, relying solely on the MedPAR record will miss any procedures that occur outside a hospital's inpatient department. In recent years, a few percent of catheterization and PCI procedures have occurred in hospital outpatient departments, rather than inpatient departments.  3  As a result, a pair of SAS scripts has been developed to address both of these problems by incorporating outpatient and physician claims data into the MedPAR data. The physician claims data are useful because, when a physician performs a surgical procedure, the physician obtains payment via a Part B physician claim. Physician claims must include the date of the procedure performed and, hence, may provide more precise information on procedure dates than MedPAR (or outpatient) records. In particular, dates are almost never missing on the physician records.  The script  Step1_tagProcs.sas  identifies all relevant procedures in the MedPAR, physician, and outpatient claims records. The program reshapes the MedPAR and outpatient claims from a wide, with 6 procedures per observation, into a long format which has one procedure code per observation. The data output from this script can have several procedure types (e.g. cath) tagged for an associated index event since the script simply takes a grouping of procedure codes and then applies a procedure tag. For example, the codes associates several type of ICD-9-CM and HCPCS procedure codes with a \"cath\" procedure. If an in individual stay has several of these associated \"cath\" codes, each separate code is tagged as a separate cath procedure in the code.  Another data issue arises for a very small percent of cases where there appears to be a transfer 4  on the date of the procedure. The result is that there are two claims with the same procedure code and date. We simply drop one of these cases.  Procedures on the MedPAR files are identified using the same set of ICD-9-CM codes described above. Procedures in physician claims are identified using the CPT (HCPCS) codes listed in Lucas et al. (2006) as well as older CPT codes obtained by searching through old CPT manuals. As noted above, the outpatient files report both ICD-9-CM and CPT (HCPCS) procedures codes over much of the period, and neither set of codes seems to provide a comprehensive accounting of the procedures reported on the claim. Consequently, the code uses both ICD-9-CM and CPT codes to identify outpatient procedures.  This script uses ICD-9-CM procedures codes in the MedPAR extract to identify which individuals underwent the following four procedures (or groups of procedures):    Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography.  Catheterization and angiography are typically part of the same procedure, and precisely which code appears on a record seems to vary arbitrarily, so they are grouped together. For simplicity, the script simply refers to this category as \"cath.\" The script uses the ICD-9-CM codes used in the 2008  Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care  to identify this group. The script also assumes that catheterization occurred if PCI or CABG occurred, even if the record does not include an explicit code for catheterization. 5  With PCI, the procedure itself involves catheterization, so this is a safe assumption. In the case of CABG, some type of catheterization typically occurs in advance of or as part of the CABG procedure.    Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with or without stent insertion.  This category includes both coronary angioplasty and coronary atherectomy. 6  Again, the script uses the ICD-9-CM codes from the Dartmouth Atlas for details, see the NHCS ICD-9-CM conversion table referenced in Section 1.    PCI with stent insertion.  To identify stent insertion, the script uses two ICD-9-CM codes: 3606 and 3607.   Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.  The script uses the ICD-9-CM codes from the Atlas.   The script  Step2_matchProcs.sas  takes the output of this last script and attempts to integrate the physician, MedPAR, and outpatient claims. The SAS program attempts to reconcile all the records by first implementing an exact matching scheme across all the claims. Next a fuzzy match algorithm is used to match carrier procedures which fall within claim end and start date on the institutional claims. The remaining unmatched carrier claims are discarded and any unmatched MedPAR or outpatient procedures are kept in the file.  While the different sources of information match in the sizable majority of cases, there are some inconsistencies. This script generates a variety of information that allows more detailed analysis of these inconsistencies.  Coping with the discrepancies requires understanding why they are occurring. There are a variety of possible explanations 7 . One possibility is that the set of ICD-9-CM or CPT codes used to identify procedures may be incomplete. Investigating this possibility is the subject of ongoing work, but direct examination of physician and inpatient claims in cases of discrepancies has not yet unearthed obvious additional codes to include. Instead, it appears that there are deficiencies in the claims record themselves.  The deficiencies in the underlying claims records may take a variety of forms. One possibility is that institutions or physicians sometimes fail to report all relevant procedure codes. There are, for example, many cases in which MedPAR records fail to list any procedure codes at all, even when it seems likely that some procedure occurred during the stay. Conversely, the six procedure fields on the MedPAR record sometimes fill up completely. In either case, the MedPAR record will not include all procedures that actually occurred during the stay. Similarly, it appears that physicians sometimes fail to file claims for all or part of a procedure. For example, there are a moderately large number of cases where there is MedPAR record showing a bypass surgery and a corresponding physician claim for some related procedure (e.g. heart procedure anesthesia), but no claim for the bypass itself.  Alternatively, providers may be reporting incorrect dates. Even if both the institution and the physician reported the procedure, if one or both of them reports an incorrect date, then it will be difficult or impossible to match the procedures together.  It is probably impossible to perfectly reconcile to the two sets of records. However, the following set of assumptions, allow a reconciliation that is likely approximately correct:   All procedures reported actually occurred (with the possible exception of some bypass surgeries reported as occurring in outpatient hospital facilities). That is, in general, they are not the result of coding errors or fraud.  Both physicians and institutions sometimes fail to report procedures.  All hospital admission and discharge dates reported on MedPAR records are correct, but the procedure dates may be incorrect. (Since admission and discharge dates can factor directly into payment, this seems like a plausible assumption.)  Procedure dates reported on physician records are correct, except when there is clear evidence to the contrary (e.g. a patient does not appear to have been hospitalized on a day when he supposedly underwent bypass surgery).  Missing procedure dates are assigned to the claim admission date for MedPAR and outpatient cases.   The last portion of  Step2_matchProcs.sas  uses these assumptions to generate variables that indicate whether or not an individual has had a given procedure within 1, 3, 7, 30, 90, or 180 days after AMI. The script starts with the universe of physician-reported claims. It then:   Keeps any physician-reported procedure that falls between the start and end date of a MedPAR or outpatient claim that also reports that procedure. These procedures are dated at the date reported on the physician claim. This case covers upwards of 90 percent of all procedures.  Keeps physician-reported procedures that fall during a period when the individual was hospitalized, even if that hospitalization contains no record of the procedure. These procedures are also dated at the date reported on the physician claim.  Drops all other physician-reported claims.  Adds on any claims from the outpatient or MedPAR file that were not matched to a physician claim in step #1, with the exception of outpatient claims that report bypass surgery. Where possible, these claims are dated using the procedure date reported on the MedPAR or outpatient record. If this date is not present or falls outside of the period defined by the start and end date of the claim, then the procedure is dated at the start of the claim or hospitalization.   Using the resulting list of procedures and dates, it is then straightforward to compute which individuals have undergone which procedures at various time horizons.  The  Step1_tagProcs.sas  program creates the following files, assuming a 5 percent AMI extract was run using  bene_id s and the principal diagnosis only:   ami05_carpull : Reshapes the claims from the carrier files, tags all procedures with relevant procedure tag  ami05_mppull : Reshapes the stays from the MedPAR files, tags all procedures with relevant procedure tag  ami05_oppull : Reshapes the claims from the OP files, tags all procedures with relevant procedure tag  ami05_oprevpull : Reshapes the revenue center claims from the OP files, tags all procedures with relevant procedure tag   The  Step2_matchProcs.sas  program creates the following files, assuming a 5 percent AMI extract was run using  bene_id s and the principal diagnosis only:   ami05_procedures : Aggregates procedure information to the index level and creates index level variable indicating how many days after the index event and individual had a procedure.",

            "text": "It is often useful to know whether a patient experiencing an AMI has other conditions, in addition to an AMI. There are several different ways of estimating a comorbidity profile for individuals of interests. Most studies rely on claims from the year preceding the index event in order to avoid incorrectly assigning a complication of the diagnosis as a comorbidity.  Relying on the ~15,000 ICD-9-CM codes is simply not useful from a risk-adjustment perspective because they create relatively flat comorbidity profiles, leaving little variation to risk adjust against. As a result, several disease classifications have been developed over the years to help adjust for other preexisting conditions with respect to some outcome of interest. Although many of these classifications initially were not developed for use with administrative data sets (claims), they have been used or adjusted for such settings. An example of some of the comorbidity classifications available are the Charlson, the Deyo-Klabunde and Romano adaption of the Charlson, CCS codes, the Elixhauser and CMS- Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC).  These groupings often create a risk adjustment index, by using subjectively assigned weights to separate diseases. In many instances the code is available, one such example is the Deyo and Romano adaptation of the Charlson index available  here .  Risk-adjustment is an important aspect of an objective assessment of health care costs/measures, Klabunde et al. (2000) argue for the case of including part B claims in creating a more complete comorbidity profile of the cohort. The drawback to using part B claims is a result of the inaccuracy of the claims. In addition there is what is known as \"rule out\" claims, in which doctors bill for tests and time they use to \"rule out\" a diagnosis. While the included code does not experiment with using the part B claims, a new user should be aware that it is possible to use them as long as these issues are accounted for.  The approach followed is that of Krumholz et al.(2007) which originally made use of the CMS-HCC codes developed by Pope et al. (2004).

Visual inspection of the data identifies some conflicting information and the fact that the POS is updated in a different month relative to the Medicare claims files means that not all providers in a given year will be found in the POS file.  The Dartmouth Health Atlas created a provider ID to HRR crosswalk for 2005 and 2007. The problem with using this crosswalk when claims have been pooled annually into a longitudinal type extract, is that the definition of HRR to zip codes could have changed over time to account for changing population concentrations. Extracts which rely on claims prior to 2005, will need to deal with crosswalks associated with each year.  Individuals working with claims prior to 2005 will need to use the annual zip code to HRR crosswalk available from the Dartmouth Atlas website. The process is complicated by the fact that provider zip codes are not available from the MedPAR files and needs to be merged in from the POS file. Information about the POS is available  here .  Several programs have been developed to aid in mapping Provider ID to HRRs. The NBER currently holds POS files in a un-harmonized text format which need to be imported into SAS or Stata format before using them. The process is time consuming because it requires looking up the correct variable of interests in the code book and adding them to the dictionaries. Currently a subset of the total variables are being used, although adding extra variables to the extract is straightforward.  In addition, the POS file is updated in a different month then the claim files which leaves the possibility that provider in some years of the claims files are not found in some years of the POS.  importPOS.sas  is a program which handles many of the problems discussed here while importing the files into SAS. Once the POS file is updated, next the HRR crosswalks are stacked on top of each other and tagged with year in the  MasterHRRCross.do  program using HRR crosswalks downloaded from the Dartmouth Atlas web page.  Finally the SAS program  FixYearDifferencesBetweenMedpar.sas  takes the provider of service files and merges it with the MedPAR file while applying a series of edits to the addresses. Merging the files with the MedPAR files allows for the correction of certain providers for which no POS observation is available in a given year due to a difference in when the survey is given/updated. Lastly this script takes the data set generated by MasterHRRCross.do and merges it with the provider zip codes to create a provider, year crosswalk to HRRs.      Two specific examples I have come across are the following   Since July 2001, critical access hospitals (CAH) have had the option of submitting combined bills with physicians who perform procedure in the CAH, however physicians have the option to opt out of this and  Some services performed by internists and residents in teaching programs may become part of the hospital reimbursement under part A.

Additional documentation can be found below at:  information on physician billing  and also at the  CMS manual for physician billing \u00a0 \u21a9    The outpatient records also show a handful of CABG surgeries, which is more surprising. While it is possible that these surgeries reflect coding errors, the claims typically have corresponding physician claims, suggesting that they represent real procedures. In addition, the claim start and end dates are typically a few weeks apart, which is highly atypical for outpatient claims, but consistent with the recovery period from bypass surgery.\u00a0 \u21a9    A transfer in the sense of a separate observation in the MedPAR file, each observation is supposed to capture a hospital or SNF stay. See Section 1 for more information.\u00a0 \u21a9    This could occur because the hospital did not code all procedures performed or because there was not enough room on the MedPAR record to code all procedures.\u00a0 \u21a9    It is not possible to focus solely on angioplasty since each ICD-9-CM code for angioplasty also covers atherectomy.\u00a0 \u21a9    In addition to the explanations given below, a small number of the discrepancies arise from a purely mechanical feature of the data set. Recall that MedPAR claims are included only if the discharge date comes within one year of AMI. Consequently, a procedure conducted during a hospital stay that starts less than a year after AMI but concludes more than a year after AMI will not appear in the MedPAR extract, but may appear in the physician extract. Even after accounting for this mechanical effect, however, the bulk of the discrepancies still remain.\u00a0 \u21a9    Link \u00a0 \u21a9    The code can be found on the CMS Risk Adjustment website  here .

            "text": "Generating costs measures from the claims files\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis documentation is ported from NBER documentation \nhere\n, written by Maurice Dalton.\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce the initial cohort is extracted, the claims files have been harmonized but are left in a fairly raw form. The next step involves aggregating the raw data into some measures which can be used in the analysis. This section reviews how to use the extracted claims to generate cost of care metrics. There are many important issues which need to be considered before adopting a specific cost measure. For one, provider costs are not reported in the claims data, what are reported are the amount charged and the total amount a provider receives for any given procedure/treatment. Although somewhat imprecise, the amount Medicare reimburses a provider is some time referred to as costs because it is thought to be a fairly good proxy for the actual costs a provider incurs.\n\n\nGenerating cost statistics from the claims data involves ensuring that that the beneficiaries in your sample are enrolled in the medicare part you are interested in and are not in an HMO during the time period your interested in. For example, if you are interested in looking at physician costs in the Carrier files 6 months after a heart attack, you should be sure to only include beneficiaries enrolled in Part B who are not in an HMO during that 6 month period. Failing properly drop individuals who are either not in part B or are serviced by an HMO will result in missing claims at work and mis-reported claims at worst therefore significantly skewing any statistics calculated. The enrollment restriction is taken care of by the software but is worth mentioning because of the complexity and confusion.\n\n\nThis portion of the documentation is devoted to describing the associated code which generates a total reimbursement/cost metric and a cost utilization metric. The following section is split between the two different cost measures. The first section provides a review of the traditional cost measure used in the literature; the total amount reimbursed for a procedure/stay. While the following section documents our 'cost utilization' measurement by providing an overview of the reimbursement systems and documenting the code used to generate the cost utilization metric.\n\n\nCost measure: total reimbursement\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe \nCumulativeCostsPerIndx.sas\n program creates total reimbursement paid to the provider at different day intervals. The cost metrics generated capture total reimbursements which includes the adjustments CMS makes to specific hospital given their characteristics and geographic location. These programs generate cost of care measure which sum reimbursements occurring \nX\n days from the index event and collapses the data set to the index event level. For example the program generates 30-day costs for Part A and Part B, medPAR, carrier, outpatient and many other sub-classifications of claims.\n\n\nThe documentation proceeds as follows; first the different entities which submit payment to providers is reviewed. Since the claims files are billing records, each cost related variable in the data can be grouped into payment from one of these entities. The final section concludes with an overview of the \nCumulativeCostsPerIndx.sas\n program which creates the costs statistics and the different types of files it creates. A useful report about the different reimbursement systems can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nDefining total costs as payments made to providers\n\u00b6\n\n\nProviders can be thought of receiving payment for care from three separate entities in the claims files:\n\n\n\n\nMedicare reimbursement\n: The primary payment comes from Medicare and is equal to the amount which Medicare decides to reimburse.\n\n\nBeneficiary payment\n:  Beneficiaries are the second entity contributing to the payments made to providers.\n\n\nSecondary payers\n:  In some instances an individual may have more than one insurance policy or coverage through some other organization. When an individuals has this type of coverage there are a set of rules which determine who pays first. Secondary payers refers to these other types health coverage which are responsible for part of the bill before Medicare is.\n\n\n\n\nIn turn each of these entities has separate associated variables found in the Medicare claims files. In some instances these variables are different across the different claims files. ResDAC provides (upon request) several different worksheets which describe which variables found in the claims files need to be aggregated to obtain the payment to a provider. The following table provides links to these tables. Some care should be taken when applying these definitions to the older claims files as these files are created for the most recent files. This is especially important in the Outpatient and Carrier files where new payment systems were implemented 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim Files\n\n\nPDF\n\n\nReceived from ResDAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR (Inpatient)\n\n\nlink\n\n\nJune 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nlink\n\n\nJune 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient\n\n\nlink\n\n\nJune 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDurable Medical Equipment (DME)\n\n\nlink\n\n\nJune 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Health Agencies (HHA)\n\n\nlink\n\n\nJune 2011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1 ResDAC's Medicare variable aggregations for different costs\n\n\nCarrier costs extraction program/claim specific information\n\u00b6\n\n\nIt is useful to review the structure of the files prior to working with them. Recall that each claim present in the Carrier files is made up of several line items. The NBER SAS extraction code extracts information for index events at the line item level because it allows researchers to dis-aggregate costs and other information at the smallest level possible. However, some variables are only available on the claims for a group of associated 'line items'. In these cases the code merges claim level information to the line item level, creating some redundancy.\n\n\nIn calculating reimbursements (according to correspondence with ResDAC) users can sum variables which covers payments from the 3 entities described in the previous section, see ResDAC documentation. The documentation recommends using the line allowed charge amount (\nlalowchg\n) in order to get a measure of total reimbursement. The latter is used in the cost programs because it is available for all years (see \nstayCost\n variable). Lastly, because some claims or line items maybe denied, ResDAC also suggests dropping all denied claims and line items before calculating costs as is done in the SAS code.\n\n\nOutpatient cost extraction program/claim specific information\n\u00b6\n\n\nSimilar to the Carrier files the Outpatient files provide a claim and revenue center level observations. The revenue centers can be thought of as the analog of the line item and provide much more detailed information about the specific claim of interest. However, the code does not extract the outpatient files at the revenue center level, instead it leaves the claims in its 'relational' form. Note that for total costs purposes, the variable \npmt_amt\n, found on the claims files, is used because it includes total payments for both the associated revenue center and claims files. Therefore the code does not need to use revenue center level claims when constructing costs as the total amount reimbursed.\n\n\nCumulativeCostsPerIndx.sas\n costs programs\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe goal of the \nCumulativeCostsPerIndx.sas\n program is to aggregate the claims and create X-day cost measures relative to the index event date. The final data set will have several variables describing costs at the index event level, which can be merged with an other file by using the \ndiag_id\n variable. Note that the program looks to estimates all-payment received by the provider , equal to all payment made from the three groups \nMEDICARE REIMB + BENE PAYMENT + SECONDARY PAY\n. Embedded in the code, comments document the exact variables used to generate a measure of spending.\n\n\nThe code assumed that costs in claims are linear over time in the case where a length of stay is longer then the \nX\n days cost metric being constructed. For example if a claim started on the 26\nth\n day after the index event and lasted through the 35\nth\n day after the index event, 30 days costs would include 50% \n((30-26+1)/(35-26+1))\n((30-26+1)/(35-26+1))\n of the associated costs for that claim.\n\n\nIn addition to information on the actual amount a provider is payed, the bill or charge amount a provider sends to Medicare is also available in the claims files. For the most part we extract information regarding expenditures in the code, however it is just as easy to move forward and extract charge information if one was so inclined by adding the variables of interest to the extraction programs.\n\n\nLastly, the code goes ahead and splits costs in the MedPAR file by provider type using the provider numbers. The different grouping in part reflect the different type of PPS systems found in the MedPAR file.\n\n\nThe \nCumulativeCostsPerIndx.sas\n program creates the following files, assuming a five percent extract was run:\n\n\n\n\nami05_alldcost\n: Combines cost/reimbursement information from the MedPAR, Carrier and OP files. Output at to the index level.\n\n\nami05_carcost\n: Creates reimbursement/costs measures for index events at different day levels using the Carrier files - erased.\n\n\nami05_mparcost\n: Creates reimbursement/costs measures for index events at different day levels using the MedPAR files - erased.\n\n\nami05_opcost\n: Creates reimbursement/costs measures for index events at different day levels using the OP files - erased.\n\n\n\n\nCost measure: cost of health care utilization & Medicare payment system overview\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis section turns to the more involved task of separating payments made to providers based for the amount of care provider or utilized from the reimbursement made to providers based on non-utilization factors. In order to do so an understanding of the different payment systems is needed. The following subsections will be broken down by Medicare claim type (MedPAR, Carrier or Outpatient), each section will review the different payment systems found within each claim file noting that not all payment systems have a cost-utilization measure created for them. Each section will provide an overview of the payment systems found in each claim file and will close with describing how the cost utilization measure for the given payment system is constructed in the code.\n\n\nGenerally, each payment system follows a similar formula where a weight, assigned to the care received, describes the intensity of care relative to some average level of care. However converting this level of care into a dollar amount requires a base dollar amount CMS refers to as a conversion factor, which is updated annually. The weight and conversion factor determine the reimbursement a provider receives for the services rendered to a patient, however their are additional multipliers or add-ons specific to different payment systems which compensate a provider for non-utilization characteristics.\n\n\nOne notable exception exists for these payment systems exists in the case of Maryland. \n1\n The programs presented in this section do not attempt to account for Maryland specific reimbursement rules or exclude claims occurring in Maryland. Researchers should be aware of this issue.\n\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, users looking for more in-depth descriptions of payment systems should first check the MedPAC site for information regarding reimbursement systems, then look through CMS published final rules and finally move onto the internet-only manuals (IOM). Each resource goes into much more detail then the previous and its advisable to try to get a top down understanding before moving into too fine of detail on the reimbursement systems. It is worth noting that while the formulas appear straightforward, in practice they may lack many important details. In order to truly capture the reimbursement system with greater accuracy would in some cases involve a level of granularity which is difficult to attain. Furthermore, the changing reimbursement policies over time would also need to be replicated. With these warning in mind, the following section provides an overview of how the current reimbursement systems function. Information on final rules as well as a short overview of the different formulas CMS uses in calculating the reimbursement are discussed. In addition to the final rules, a direct link to the current regulations is available \nhere\n.\n\n\nFinally, users looking to run the \ncostutilization\n programs should note that there are several SAS programs which provide the cost utilization code, however the structure is different then some of the other programs included in the main extraction portion of the code. All programs used are controlled by a master program which calls all of the subprograms for the different reimbursement systems. The program is called \nCallAllCostUtilizationPrgms.sas\n. The code used is nested according to the payment system used. Individuals need only run this program and comment out what parts of the program they do not want to run.\n\n\nDifference between Dartmouth index and cost utilization measure developed here\n\u00b6\n\n\nResearchers at Dartmouth developed a cost utilization index, described in detail by Gottlieb et al. (2010), and made the index available to the public. While the methodology used in many instance is close, the Dartmouth index and the cost utilization measures defined here do have several substantial differences which we believe make our measure more flexible. The first major difference is that the Dartmouth index only goes back to 2003 and is only made available at the state and HRR level. The geographic level of aggregation would not be adequate in studies concentrating on provider level outcomes. The index is also aggregated across several different payment systems which may or may not be a problem for some studies. However, the largest difference between these measures is in how Dartmouth multiplies their index by a constant every year to ensure that cost utilization measures equal total cost. We do not do this with our measures because it would make comparing them over time difficult, since the constant would change annually therefore potentially biasing longitudinal comparisons\n2\n.\n\n\nMedPAR cost utilization measures (AIPPS only)\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe MedPAR file is generated from the inpatient and skilled nursing facility claims files. While the largest payment system, in terms of expenditures, is the Acute Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) which deals with short-term inpatient facilities their are several other reimbursement systems found in the MedPAR claims files for which no cost-utilization measure was constructed. Specifically the following table documents the payment systems and whether a cost-utilization measure has been constructed for them. However it is worth noting that many of the other payment systems use the hospital wage index to adjust prices, and adjusting these other systems by the wage index would help get closer to the amount reimbursed for the care given by a provider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment System\n\n\nYear Implemented\n\n\nCost-utilization Measure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcute Inpatient PPS (AIPPS)\n\n\n1984\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInpatient Rehab PPS\n\n\nJanuary 2002\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-Term Inp Care PPS\n\n\nOctober 2002\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychiatric Inpatient PPS\n\n\nJanuary 2005\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Access Hospitals\n\n\n1998?\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkilled Nursing Facility PPS\n\n\n1998\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.2 Payment systems found in the MedPAR file\n\n\nCMS describes in complete detail any changes made to their reimbursement policy in an annual document published August 1\nst\n, effective October 1\nst\n. The document known as the Acute IPPS final rule is updated on a fiscal year basis. Therefore researchers interested in studying changes to the Acute IPPS may yield cleaner results, with respect to the impact of reimbursement changes, if they work with fiscal as opposed to calendar years.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIt is important for a researcher to realize that skilled nursing facilities and long-term care inpatient stays are also found in the MedPAR file but are reimbursed under a different payment system.\n\n\n\n\nOverview of CMS Acute Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) reimbursement policy\n\u00b6\n\n\nLincoln,New Hampshire\n\n\nThe Social Security Amendments of 1983 established the prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services. The PPS established excludes children and cancer hospitals, as well as hospitals located outside of the 50 states. In addition, the statute allows for other exclusions like hospitals that are covered under state reimbursement control systems. These hospitals are paid on the basis of reasonable costs (IOM, Chapter 3 Inpatient Billing, Section 20).\n\n\nProvider numbers 21000-21099 in Maryland are paid 94% of submitted charges subject to any unmet Part B deductible and coinsurance. (IOM, Chapter 3 Inpatient Billing, Section 20).\n\n\nCMS reimburses individuals based on standardized capital and operating base amounts. Several adjustments are applied to the base amounts which account for wage differentials, urban/rural settings, teaching hospitals, disproportionate share and several other policy type adjustments. For a useful graphic of the costs refer to \nMedPAC's hospital payment basics overview\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotalReimbursement\u2005=\u2005Operating\u2005+\u2005Capital\n\n\n\n\nTotalReimbursement\u2005=\u2005Operating\u2005+\u2005Capital\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating = DRG_{hps}\n\\left( 1 + dish_h^{op} + teach_h^{op} \\right)\n\\left( B_h^{NL} + B_h^L \\cdot W_h^L \\right)\n\n\n\n\nOperating = DRG_{hps}\n\\left( 1 + dish_h^{op} + teach_h^{op} \\right)\n\\left( B_h^{NL} + B_h^L \\cdot W_h^L \\right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital\u2005=\u2005DRG_{hps}\n\\left( 1\u2005+\u2005dish_h^{cap} \u2005+\u2005teach_h^{cap} \\right)\n\\left( B_h^{NL} + B_h^L \\cdot W_h^K \\right)\n\n\n\n\nCapital\u2005=\u2005DRG_{hps}\n\\left( 1\u2005+\u2005dish_h^{cap} \u2005+\u2005teach_h^{cap} \\right)\n\\left( B_h^{NL} + B_h^L \\cdot W_h^K \\right)\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS reimburses inpatient providers on operating and capital expenses each of which are based on the \nDRG_{hps}\nDRG_{hps}\n assigned to the \ns\ns\nth stay of the \np\np\nth patient in the \nh\nh\nth hospital. DRGs are assigned on discharge from an inpatient facility and are therefore associated with a specific stay (not claim). Since they are assigned on discharge the MedPAR and Inpatient files can be thought of as being equivalent when summarizing DRGs for an associated event.\n\n\nCMS reimbursement calculations begin with an adjusted base labor \nB_h^L\nB_h^L\n and non-labor \nB_h^{NL}\nB_h^{NL}\n amount. These base amounts depend on whether the location of the \nh\nh\nth hospital has an associated wage index which is less then or greater than 1. Next a geographic wage adjustment is applied to the \nB_h^L\nB_h^L\n in the form of a wage index dependent on the location of the hospital. Once the \nB_h^L\nB_h^L\n is adjusted, \nB_h^{NL}\nB_h^{NL}\n is added to it a series of policy adjustments scale the reimbursement amount for different hospital specific factors. Finally this scaled amount is further multiplied by the DRG weight. The process is applied to both operating and capital amounts. Note that in the case of the capital amount it is adjusted by a geographic adjustment (GAF), \nW_h^K\nW_h^K\n, which is not equal to the wage index used in the operating amount.\n\n\nOther factors impacting DRG reimbursement\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn addition to the generic DRG based reimbursement there are several other factors which may determine different reimbursement amount which include but are not limited to the following:\n\n\n\n\nTransfer cases or cases with a length of stay less then the geometric mean\n\n\nOutlier payments\n\n\nAdd on payments for new technology\n\n\nOther provider specific adjustments\n\n\n\n\nMore information can be found at MedPAC's payment overview, ResDAC's \nDRG payment document\n, CMS's Internet Only Manuals, Chapter 3 and also American Health Information Management Association's (AHIMA) Coding and Reimbursement for Hospital Inpatient Services, see \nhere\n for chapter 1 from an old version of the book.\n\n\nDRG weights\n\u00b6\n\n\nDRG weights are not available in the Medicare claims data, and need to be merged in from the annual DRG weight files. For recent regulation CMS has made the historical DRG weight file available.\n\n\nAcute IPPS cost-utilization program\n\u00b6\n\n\nProgram: \nInpatientPPS_calc.sas\n\n\nEquation (4) describes the cost-utilization measure constructed from the IAPPS and generated in the code. Note that the base payment amount, which can be thought of as the conversion factor ($/DRG weight) is taken from the Table 1A/B in the Appendix of the IAPPS final rules. One complication is that the final rule reports two base payments depending on the whether the hospital location has a wage adjustment factor greater then or equal to 1 (urban) or less then 1 (rural). The difference is small between the two amounts and we choose to first add the non-labor and labor amount together then take the average between the urban and rural quantities as defined in equation 4. See \nImportDRGinfo.sas\n for exact labor/non-labor amount and in some instance capital amounts in the urban/rural setting. The quantities used as the conversion factor are displayed in 6.3\u2193.\n\n\n\n\n\noperatingcost_{utilization} = DRG_{hps}\n\\left[\n\\frac{\n    \\left( B_{w \\geq 1}^{NL} + B_{w \\geq 1}^L \\right)\n     + \\left( B_{w < 1}^{NL} + B_{w < 1}^L \\right)}{2}\n\\right]\n\n\n\n\noperatingcost_{utilization} = DRG_{hps}\n\\left[\n\\frac{\n    \\left( B_{w \\geq 1}^{NL} + B_{w \\geq 1}^L \\right)\n     + \\left( B_{w < 1}^{NL} + B_{w < 1}^L \\right)}{2}\n\\right]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\nConversion Factor ($/DRG weight)\n\n\nReference rule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1992\n\n\n3443.236\n\n\nFR:: Aug 30,1991 pg 43249\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1993\n\n\n3662.173\n\n\nFR:: Sep 1,1992 pg 39845\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1994\n\n\n3660.383\n\n\nFR:: Sep 1,1993 pg 46362\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1995\n\n\n3764.665\n\n\nFR:: Sep 1,1994\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1996\n\n\n3809.090\n\n\nFR:: Sep 1,1995\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1997\n\n\n3877.550\n\n\nFR:: August 30,1996\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1998\n\n\n3873.745\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1999\n\n\n3974.830\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2000\n\n\n3919.745\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2001\n\n\n3996.515\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2002\n\n\n4123.830\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2003\n\n\n4217.550\n\n\nCMS-1470-CN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\n\n4377.820\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2005\n\n\n4554.255\n\n\nCMS-1482-F2: pg 23483\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\n4714.690\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\n\n4874.490\n\n\nCMS-1488-N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n4960.640\n\n\nCMS-1533-CN2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n5097.460\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n5128.560\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.3 Historical IAPPS base payment/conversion factors ($/DRG weight)\n\n\n\n\nami05_claimsDRGQ\n: Generates medpar stay level cost utilization measure - \ninpatient_Q\n .

Additionally, some services are priced regionally by the organizations which process the claims, referred to as Carriers, while other services are paid on a \"reasonable charge\" basis. Still some services which are covered can be bundled together. The cost-utilization measure developed here for use with the carrier files, covers all line items for the PFS. For line items with no RVU found in the PFS, the median reimbursement amount is used as the cost utilization measure.\n\n\nOverview of CMS PFS reimbursement policy\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe PFS was originally developed by Hsiao and Braun at the Harvard School of Public Health in the late 1980s. However as part of the maintenance of the PFS, the American Medical Association (AMA) offered to take on the role of updating the PFS to account for differences in payment structures and began to do so in 1992 as part of the 5-year maintenance review. Conversion factors are updated annually to account for increases in cost, where as RVU weights are updated annually to account for new codes with a more general review occuring every five-years, is a more in depth review which looks to make sure that the RVU weights keep pace with changes in the way medicine is practiced.\n\n\nHistorically, the RVU where calculated using charges from past claims, although beginning in 1999 the transition from a charge based to a resource based RVU methodology was fully implemented in 2002. The following provides a brief overview of the general formula CMS uses to calculate reimbursements. For further information refer to the IOM, CMS published final rules or \nthis MedPAC document\n.\n\n\nThe physician fee schedule maps HCPCS codes to relative value unit (\nRVU\nRVU\n) weights associated with three different costs associated with physician providing care. Practice expense RVUs ( \nRVU^{PE}\nRVU^{PE}\n ) capture the costs associated with renting office space, buying supplies and hiring non-physician clinical and administrative staff. Work RVUs ( \nRVU^W\nRVU^W\n) capture the costs associated with physicians time for providing a service to a patient. Professional liability insurance RVUs ( \nRVU^{PLI}\nRVU^{PLI}\n) capture the costs associated with the premium a physician pays for liability insurance. As the following formula shows, each of these components are adjusted by a specific geographic practice cost index (\nGPCI\nGPCI\n) relevant to each component. Note that the RVU weights are defined for the \nl\nl\nth line items associated with the \nc\nc\nth claim and \np\np\nth patients treated at the \nh\nh\nth hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nC^{CAR} \\left(\nRVU_{hpcl}^W \\cdot GPCI_h^W +\nRVU_{hpcl}^{PE} \\cdot GPCI_h^{PE} +\nRVU_{hpcl}^{PLI} \\cdot GPCI_h^{PLI}\n\\right)\n+ Policy_h\n\n\n\n\nC^{CAR} \\left(\nRVU_{hpcl}^W \\cdot GPCI_h^W +\nRVU_{hpcl}^{PE} \\cdot GPCI_h^{PE} +\nRVU_{hpcl}^{PLI} \\cdot GPCI_h^{PLI}\n\\right)\n+ Policy_h\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the RVUs have been adjusted for geographic costs and then summed together a conversion factor is used to transform the RVU weights into an associated dollar amount meant to capture the intensity of a specific procedure. Additionally, the physician fee schedule is adjusted based on the whether the physician provides the care in facility or non-facility setting. Finally, line items occurring during or after 2007 use the transitional PE RVU, rather then the implemented PE RVU which is used before 2007.\n\n\nMerging in the physician fee schedule\n\u00b6\n\n\nRVU weights are not available in the Medicare claims data, and need to be merged in from the physician fee schedule. The physician fee schedule is identified at the HCPCS code and for some HCPCS code modifiers. While the physician fee schedule only has \nTC\n, \n26\n, and \n53\n modifier codes, the Medicare claims files have many more modifier codes. The reason for this disconnect is that not all modifier codes are of importance in determining the amount a code is reimbursed \n3\n. In order to merge the claims and fee schedule, first merge on calendar year, HCPCS code and modifier code (only the first modifier). For all non matching merges, merge on calendar year and HCPCS code. A small percent of claims is not matched and are dropped from the sample.\n\n\nFor the most part the file weights are updated annually with the exception of certain new technology which is deemed important enough for Medicare to start reimbursement. In order to be able to adapt to these instances, Medicare publishes the fee schedule quarterly. For most purposes using the last quarter, the \"D\" files, will suffice. The \"D\" files are used by the programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nCalendar Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Register Vol. 64 No. 211 / Tuesday, November 2, 1999 / Rules and Regulations pg. 59429-59590\n\n\n2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Register Vol. 65 No. 212 / Wednesday, November 1, 2000/Rules and Regulations pg. 65425-65603\n\n\n2001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Register Vol. 66 No. 212 / Thursday, November 1, 2001/Rules and Regulations pg. 55295-55503\n\n\n2002\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS webpage --valid only for March 1, 2003 \u2013 Dec 31,\n\n\n2003\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS webpage\n\n\n2004 forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.4 Annual Physician Fee Schedules Files\n\n\nStatus Indicators in the Physician Fee Schedule and Claims file\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe status indicators in the PFS describes how the HCPCS code is reimbursed and what class it falls into. They are useful for figuring out how CMS reimburses a HCPCS code and are included in the final data set for this reason.\n\n\nConversion Factors\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe conversion factors which translate RVU weights into dollar amounts are published and updated annually in the final rules. The conversion factors, CCAR can be found in the 6.5\u2193. Note that in 2008 the conversion factor was updated half-way through the year in a proposed rule but the change was never finalized and as a result never materialized. Determining the conversion factor in recent years can be tricky because CMS reports conversion factor that the sustainable growth factor (SGR) rule requires, even though congress has voided the rule every year since 2003.\n\n\nIn 2010, the conversion factor and the physician fee schedule were updated halfway through the year. On May 10, 2010 CMS released revised physician payment files to Medicare Contractors necessary to reflect changes to payments as a result of the CY 2010 correction notice published in the Federal Register on May 11, 2010 and changes resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act. This fee schedule also reflects the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2010, the Temporary Extension Act of 2010, and the Continuing Extension Act of 2010 which have provided for a zero percent update to the 2010 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and is effective for claims with dates of service from January 1, 2010 through May 31, 2010. These fees reflect a change in the conversion factor as a result of the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, which President Obama signed into law on June 25, 2010. This legislation provides for a 2.2 percent update to the 2010 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS), effective for dates of service June 1, 2010, through November 30, 2010. Revised payment files were posted by CMS on July 1, 2010 \n4\n.\n\n\nNote that the conversion factors are available from the AMA \nhere\n.

About 25% of the claims are associated with a total RVU of 0. These are largely associated with Status Codes indicating statutory exclusions, excluded from physician fee schedule by regulation, or that the carriers themselves are supposed to price the code. For these HCPCS codes a weight is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the median cost by HCPCS, HCPCS modifier code and year.\n\n\nDivide that median amount by that years conversion factor to get a weight for the HCPCS, modifier, year combination\n\n\nAssign that weight to the missing data\n\n\n\n\nAlso note that line items classified as facility/non-facility based are determined from the place of service codes where the values are defined at \nthis link\n.\n\n\nThe cost utilization amounts can now be defined by multiplying the conversion factor by the total RVU weight in the case where the RVU is not equal to zero. Cases where the RVU is equal to zero are set equal to the median reimbursement amount for the HCPCS/modifier code in a given year, as defined above. The following equation re-iterate this process.\n\n\n\n\n\ncost_{util} =\n\\begin{cases}\nC^{CAR} \\left( RVU_{hpcl}^W + RVU_{hpcl}^{PE} + RVU_{hpcl}^{PLI} \\right) & if RVU \\not = 0 \\\\\nreimbursement_{year}^{median} & if RVU = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\n\n\n\ncost_{util} =\n\\begin{cases}\nC^{CAR} \\left( RVU_{hpcl}^W + RVU_{hpcl}^{PE} + RVU_{hpcl}^{PLI} \\right) & if RVU \\not = 0 \\\\\nreimbursement_{year}^{median} & if RVU = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nami05_RVUratio\n: Generates line item levels cost utilization measure - \nphysician_cf_Q\n corresponding to the cost utilization metric created using the conversion factor. Note that \nphysician_Q&los.\n is generated by estimating a ratio for the conversion factor an is only included for checking purposes.\n\n\nami05_HCPCS2costutil\n: Generates a crosswalk file with all the relevant information. To assign physician_Q costs to any carrier extracts, first take all modifier codes that are not equal to \nTC\n, \n53\n or \n26\n and assign them a \nMI\n code. Next merge this file with the claims files based on the year of the second line item date (\nsexpend2\n), HCPCS code, modifier and place of service (\nplcsvrvc\n).\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient cost-utilization metric\n\u00b6\n\n\nBeginning in 2001, the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) was introduced by CMS which uses a similar weight/conversion factor approach. The OPPS covers the outpatient hospital setting and covers a large amount of the claims in the outpatient claims file but there are still a significant amount of claims which the OPPS does not cover.\n\n\nSome of the other payment systems/services found in the outpatient file but not covered by OPPS are described in the following list, a more complete description can be found in \nAHIMA's Coding and Reimbursement for Hospital Outpatient Services\n (the following list is based on the descriptions given there).\n\n\n\n\nMaryland Hospital Costs Containment Services\n\n\nIndian Health Service Hospital Outpatient Services\n: paid under separately established rates and are paid in the Federal register annually\n\n\nCritical Access Hospital (CAH) Outpatient Services\n: They are paid under a reasonable cost-system\n\n\nAmbulance Services and Physical/Occupational/Speech Therapy\n (status indicator=\nA\n): paid under a fee-schedule\n\n\nServices Already Paid For under Fee Schedule or Other Payment Systems\n (status indicator=\nA\n): screening mammography, services for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that are paid for under the ESRD composite rate, laboratory services paid for under the clinical diagnostic laboratory fee schedule, and DME, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS), including prosthetic devices and implants, paid for under the DMEPOS fee schedule when the hospital is acting as a supplier of these items. See (AHIMA, 2005) for examples.\n\n\nOutpatients services furnished to SNF Inpatients\n: If the care is part of their comprehensive care plan then SNF PPS covers these costs\n\n\nInpatient Procedures\n: procedures which CMS will only reimburse if they have occurred in an inpatient setting. CMS chooses these procedures because the it is not appropriate to preform them in an outpatients setting or because they are almost done in an inpatient setting. Inpatients of a Skilled Nursing Facility. See AHIMA documents for a full list of criteria CMS uses.\n\n\nPre-admission Diagnostic and non-diagnostic Services\n: Beginning January 1,1991 diagnostic and non-diagnostic outpatient services provided to a Medicare beneficiary by an admitting hospital within three days of admission are covered by Part A\n\n\nAmbulatory Surgery Centers (ASC)\n5\n\n\n\n\nThe cost-utilization metric generated only covers the OPPS portion of the claims, the importance of the other payments systems will depend on the specifics of the study in question. For example, a researchers studying heart attacks and looking at 3 day costs will see that the ambulatory fee schedule plays an important role in describing total costs, and therefore the cost utilization metric created below, which only covers the OPPS, will miss a large portion of costs. Similarly, users looking at trends before 2001, should note that the OPPS started in 2001 and therefore our cost-utilization measure only starts in 2001.\n\n\nProspective Payment System (OPPS)\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe mandate for an outpatient PPS systems can be found in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA 1986) and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990). Over the next 14 years a series of different regulations were passed which prepared the the outpatient system for a PPS. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provided the implementation for such a system beginning January 1,1999. The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 made further changes to the impending OPPS system. However due to the concern around the Y2K computer bug, the implementation was pushed back to late 2000.(AHIMA, 2005).\n\n\nBefore the OPPS was implemented in late 2000, the outpatient claims were reimbursed using a charge based method, a fee-schedule or some blend of the two. The use of provider specific charges complicates estimating a utilization specific cost amount because geographic and provider specific differences in treatment and billing are mixed in the charges, leaving the researcher with the task of developing a method for separating the two. The methods discuses in the following section for separating policy adjustments from utilization costs are not valid for pre-OPPS data and is not covered by the methods discussed here. For more information about the OPPS and the the reimbursement systems used before the implementation of OPPS in the Outpatient files refer to the following RAND documentWynn (2005) . The remainder of the section will focus on the OPPS which was implemented in 2001.\n\n\nAn outpatient claim can be reimbursed through more then one Medicare payment system because Medicare reimburses for services in the outpatient files at the revenue center level, not the claim level. Since medicare reimburses at the revenue center levels, generating a cost utilization measure specific to a Medicare payment system requires working with costs and procedures codes (HCPCS) at the revenue center level.\n\n\nThe OPPS is reviewed in the following sections, broadly characterizing how reimbursements are calculated. The sections will describe specific aspects of the OPPS like identifying which claims fall under the OPPS and which do not. The OPPS analog to the Inpatient PPS DRGs are the ambulatory patient groups (APCs), a brief overview of APCs are also provided. Finally a general formula used to calculate OPPS reimbursements are reviewed.\n\n\nRESOURCES ON OPPS:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.irp.com/apc/training/oppchap5.html#_Toc487605397\n\n\nWynn (2005)\n\n\nAHIMA's Coding and Reimbursement for Hospital Outpatient Services\n\n\nMedPAC's OPPS payment basics documentation.\n\n\nCMS Internet Only Manuals (IOM)\n\n\nGrimaldi, Paul(2002).

They apply a wage index associated with where the hospital is located,W Lh , to the labor portion of the conversion factor which depends on the specific hospital's geography. Next the adjusted conversion factor is multiplied by the APC weight. The conversion factor transforms the APC weight into a dollar amount. The last step is to add in any additional policy adjustments related to hospital specific characteristic, \nPolicy_h\nPolicy_h\n. For more information see MedPAC's OPPS payment basics documentation and CMS Internet Only Manuals (IOM).\n\n\nNote that the COPPS is updated on an annual basis in the OPPS Final Rule. The annual uprate is based on the inpatients market basket percentage increase applicable to hospital discharges and further adjusted to ensure budget neutrality.\n\n\nWhile the reimbursement equation is fairly straightforward, there are various different rules which determine how exactly a procedure is reimbursed. The first complication involves determining which claims are covered by OPPS. The \"status indicator\" does this by classifying claims into categories explaining how they are reimbursed.\n\n\nThere are various places where the status indicator is available. The outpatient claims have a status indicator variable. CMS also publishes an annual HCPCs to APC crosswalk in the final rule under Addendum B. The crosswalk is useful in that it also includes status indicator codes as well as copayment amounts for every HCPCS code.\n\n\nCoinsurance is another major portion of the OPPS which may be of interest in determining total costs. As of 2005, the standard 20% Medicare copayment amount was gradually applied to the OPPS copayment rates. For certain APC groups with a relatively high copayment compared to total payment, the policy was particularly worrisome for some outpatient facilities. As a result, CMS has established national copayment amount for each APC, as well as a minimum or floor price (equal to 20% of total payment). Hospitals are allowed to set the copayment amount between these two rates once a year and advertise these reduced rates. Note prior to the OPPS, coinsurance rates were based on charges not the actual amount reimbursed which lead to coinsurance rates making up a large portion of the total payment to providers.\n\n\nIn some cases, the OPPS has changed the way it reimburses for services which were qualified to receive transitional pass through payments, certain drugs which meet a cost threshold and for new technology where no charge/cost data is available to assign it to an APC. In most of these cases no relative weight is assigned to the appropriate HCPCS code in Addendum A or B. Instead a dollar amount is simply stated for that payment amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment Type\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiscount eligible HCPCS\n\n\nDiscount applied if several HCPCS codes which are eligible for a discount appear on the same revenue center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npass-through payments HCPCS\n\n\nImplemented to ensure the transition to OPPS did not adversely impact providers, pass-through payments set to expire. DME and prescription drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\naverage sales price\n\n\nDrugs which crossed a cost threshold were reimbursed according to the average sales price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npackaged HCPCS codes\n\n\nA key feature of the OPPS is the use of packaging services to gain efficiencies. When an HCPCS code is packaged no weight is assigned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.7 Payment type found in the claims files\n\n\nIdentifying OPPS claims, APC weights and conversion factors in the claims file\n\u00b6\n\n\nDetermining which claims are covered by the OPPS is the first step to creating the cost utilization metric. CMS does this through the use of what they call status indicators. A status indicator is mapped to the claims files through the use Addendum B which is part of every final rule. The file is basically a crosswalk between HCPCS codes and APC codes with all of the relevant information.\n\n\nNote that the outpatient claims have a variable \u201capchipps\u201c which should provide an APC for each revenue center observation. However in practice I have found that these variables are not very consistent with what is found in Addendum B. More specifically, the APCs found in \napchipps\n and those found by merging Addendum B only have 60% correlation between 2001 and 2008. Looking at the annual correlations shows extremely inconsistent results. In addition, CMS also includes a variable for status indicators - \npmtmthd\n - which shows several different status indicators for APCs found in \napchipps\n. It appears that \napchipps\n has a large majority of claims with a \n0000\n code which indicates that these revenue centers have been packaged \u2014 a \nN\n status indicator.\n\n\nAddendum B is the key file necessary for identifying outpatient claims covered by the OPPS and also for defining the associated payment weight or payment amount for each APC. The file need only be merged with the HCPCS codes, a crosswalk from HCPCS code to relevant APC code, weight and payment rate. These files are used with the code provided for the OPPS to map HCPCS codes to APCs and status indicators.\n\n\nIn addition to Addendum B, the final rule published annually provides a complete description of the reimbursement changes in it entirety. Of specific interest are the conversion factors, COPPS 4\u2191, which are published annually in the final rules. However some caution needs to be used to ensure that the last final rule is used as they often go through several revisions which can be major\n7\n.\n\n\nStarting in 2009 CMS implemented the Hospital Outpatient Quality Data Reporting Program, which granted outpatient hospitals successfully reporting quality measures an additional reimbursement in the form of a higher conversion factor. We decided to use the unadjusted (reduced) conversion factor in the 2009 and 2010 years because our interest is in cost utilization, not in the added incentives in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nCalendar Year\n\n\nC^{OPPS}\nC^{OPPS}\n ($)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 7, 2000 OPPS Final Rule\n\n\n2000\n\n\n47.583\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2000 Interim Final Rule\n\n\n2001\n\n\n49.596\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 30, 2001 Final Rule\n\n\n2002\n\n\n50.904\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS Website\n\n\n2003\n\n\n52.151\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS Website\n\n\n2004\n\n\n54.561\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS Website\n\n\n2005\n\n\n56.983\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS Website\n\n\n2006\n\n\n59.511\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS Website\n\n\n2007\n\n\n61.468\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS Website\n\n\n2008\n\n\n63.694\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS Website\n\n\n2009\n\n\n64.784\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCMS Website\n\n\n2010\n\n\n66.086\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.8 Annual OPPS conversion factor amounts ($)\n\n\nAlso note that the status indicators descriptions are published annually under Addendum D.\n\n\nSAS Program: Generating OPPS cost-utilization measures\n\u00b6\n\n\nA SAS program is included in the pack at \nCombineOPclms_revcenter.sas\n to combine the claims and revenue center items. Next Addendum B is merged in with the HCPCS codes found in the outpatient file. Note that due to copyright restrictions placed on CPT codes used in Addendum B, the APCS weights are not redistributed as part of this code. Users need to download them from the CMS website.\n\n\nIn addition to importing Addendum B into a SAS file, the program also goes through and groups the HCPCS codes using the associated status indicator variables found in Addendum B into four categories indicated by the \ncostutiltype\n variable. The following section describes how the cost-utilization measure is constructed for each group.\n\"Other payment system\" HCPCS codes (\ncostutiltype = 0\n)\n\n\nAs already discussed, the outpatient files have several different payment systems which reimburse revenue center claims. While the OPPS is the largest reimbursement system, this category deals with the costs which are not covered by the OPPS. It is defined as HCPCS code with an associated status indicator (variable name \nsi\n) not in (\nG\n, \nH\n, \nK\n,\nS\n,\nP\n,\nQ\n,\nT\n,\nV\n,\nX\n,\nN\n). No cost adjustment is made of these type of claims and costs are used as is.\n\"Standard weight\" HCPCS codes (\ncostutiltype = 1\n)\n\n\nHCPCS codes with a \"standard weight\" describe HCPCS codes for which a relative APC weight exists. Calculating cost-utilization measure for these claims is straightforward for the most part, with the exception of discounted claims discussed next. For non-discounted claims, the cost-utilization measure is calculated as follows\n(6.9) costutil\u2005=\u2005COPPS\u22c6APChhpcr\n\n\nOne measure constructed \noutpatient_Q\n, ignore the discounting discused next and basically applies equation 9 to all the relevant claims. There are a handful of cases whose status indicator falls into this group but for which there are no relative weights or payment rates for these groups. These claims have a missing value assigned to the variables. The majority of these revenue centers do not report costs in the claims files.\n\n\nThe standard weight group also includes HCPCS codes which are eligible for a discount, indicated by a status indicator \nT\n code or by the \ndiscountPossilbe\n dummy variable. A discount only occurs if several HCPCS codes which are eligible for a discount appear on the same claim. In these cases, the APC weight is discounted per the OPPS rules which indicate that of all \nT\n HCPCS codes, the code with the max weight is reimbursed in full and the remaining HCPCS codes are reimbursed at 50% of the APC weight. The adjusted weight is stored in the \nupdatewght\n variable and the unadjusted weight is stored in the \nrelwght\n variable. These are coded into the program as outpatient_QTcode to allow user to compare the cost-utilization measures.\n\"Standard pay amount\" HCPCS codes (\ncostutiltype = 2\n)\n\"Standard pay amount\" HCPCS codes have no relative weight, but do have a dollar amount associated with them which are still adjusted for geography. New technology is eligible to apply for pass-though status. In addition when technology first enters the OPPS, it is assigned to and APC within a given cost band. No relative weight is associated with this APC because not enough claims data has been collected for the given technology. As more information is gathered the technology is moved from the new technology cost band and placed in an appropriate APC category.\n\n\nThe new technology appears to be geographically adjusted upon comparison in the claims files. The new technology APCS are between the following number 0970-0997 before 2004, 1501 to 1574 between 2004 and 2005 and 1492 to 1574 in 2006 and beyond. . In these instances no estimated conversion factor is used, rather the payment rate amount found on Addendum B is used.\n(6.10) costutil\u2005=\u2005payamount OPPShpcr\n\"unadjusted payment\" HCPCS codes (\ncostutiltype = 3\n)\n\n\nSome HCPCS codes are \"unadjusted\" and cover prescription drugs and some pass-through payments. Prescription drugs are based on wholesale index and not wage adjusted. Some pass-through amounts are included in this category, however pass-through payments lie in a grayer area then prescription drugs in the sense that they are often cost-based, which means that their maybe some implicit geographic variation in these amounts. Codes falling into this category are not adjusted for cost utilization, some examples include new technology which is eligible for pass-through status. The actual amount reimbursed is used.\n\n\nInitially prescription drugs were assigned there own relative weights in Addendum A and Addendum B, however in 2004 the PDMI was passed which changed the way in which reimbursement were calculated. Drugs which crossed a cost threshold were reimbursed according to the average sales price.\n\n\nPrescription drugs do not receive a wage index adjustment but their administration does because they are coded and reimbursed separately. In addition prescription drugs do not receive an adjustment for a rural location. Note that the administration of a drug does not fall in this category. \nThis paper\n provides a good overview of recent changes. Note that the payment for drugs are not adjusted\n$$\ncost_{util} = fullreimb_{reported}^{OPPS}\n$$\n\u201cPackaged Incidental service\u201c (\ncostutiltype = 4\n)\n\n\nThese are revenue centers with a status indicator of \nN\n which means that their costs have been packaged into other revenue centers observations. Addendum B provides no relative weights for these HCPCS codes and in many cases these correspond to revenue centers found in the claims files with no HCPCS code. These are identified by using the status indicator variable \npmtmthd\n found in the claims files. In some cases the claims do have an associated cost for the given, revenue centers. These costs are ignored in the \noutpatient_Q\n variable, its set to missing, because these costs are assumed to be some non-utilization costs as the documentation would suggest. Nonetheless this separate group is defined in the case an individual is interested in further looking into this group.\n$$\ncost_{util} = fullreimb_{reported}^{OPPS}\n$$\n\u201cInconsistent HCPCS codes \u201c (\ncostutiltype = 5\n)\n\n\nThese codes are inconsistent in the sense that the revenue center claims files \npmtmthd\n indicator variables denotes these claims as being covered by OPPS although their is no match for the HCPCS code in Addendum B. Closer inspection of the HCPCS codes shows that they are mostly C and G HCPCS codes. The C codes are temporary HCPCS codes and the G codes are for voluntary reporting of quality codes. This group makes up less then 1% of the claims and the total unadjusted costs are included in the \noutpatient_Q\n measures.\n$$\ncost_{util} = fullreimb_{reported}\n$$\n\u201cNo map from HCPCS codes to status indicator\u201c (\ncostutiltype = 6\n)\n\n\nThese HCPCS codes have no status indicator in the claims files and also do not match to Addendum B and are therefore unsure how to deal with these claims. This group is only a handful of claims and is mostly made of HCPCS X codes. The total unadjusted costs are included in the \noutpatient_Q\n measures.\n$$\ncost_{util} = fullreimb_{reported}\n$$\n\n\nFinal data sets\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe final data set is created at the revenue center level and contains a variable \noutpatient_Q\n and \noutpatient_QTcode\n. Each variable is defined as described for each of the groupings above, with the exception the the latter is defined with discounted weights and the former does not account for discounted weights (\nsi = T\n).\n\n\n\n\nami05_OPPSq\n: Generates revenue center level cost utilization measure - \noutpatient_Q\n corresponding to the cost utilization metric created using the conversion factor.

The next step involves aggregating the raw data into some measures which can be used in the analysis. This section reviews how to use the extracted claims to generate cost of care metrics. There are many important issues which need to be considered before adopting a specific cost measure. For one, provider costs are not reported in the claims data, what are reported are the amount charged and the total amount a provider receives for any given procedure/treatment. Although somewhat imprecise, the amount Medicare reimburses a provider is some time referred to as costs because it is thought to be a fairly good proxy for the actual costs a provider incurs.  Generating cost statistics from the claims data involves ensuring that that the beneficiaries in your sample are enrolled in the medicare part you are interested in and are not in an HMO during the time period your interested in. For example, if you are interested in looking at physician costs in the Carrier files 6 months after a heart attack, you should be sure to only include beneficiaries enrolled in Part B who are not in an HMO during that 6 month period. Failing properly drop individuals who are either not in part B or are serviced by an HMO will result in missing claims at work and mis-reported claims at worst therefore significantly skewing any statistics calculated. The enrollment restriction is taken care of by the software but is worth mentioning because of the complexity and confusion.  This portion of the documentation is devoted to describing the associated code which generates a total reimbursement/cost metric and a cost utilization metric. The following section is split between the two different cost measures. The first section provides a review of the traditional cost measure used in the literature; the total amount reimbursed for a procedure/stay. While the following section documents our 'cost utilization' measurement by providing an overview of the reimbursement systems and documenting the code used to generate the cost utilization metric.",

Beneficiary payment :  Beneficiaries are the second entity contributing to the payments made to providers.  Secondary payers :  In some instances an individual may have more than one insurance policy or coverage through some other organization. When an individuals has this type of coverage there are a set of rules which determine who pays first. Secondary payers refers to these other types health coverage which are responsible for part of the bill before Medicare is.   In turn each of these entities has separate associated variables found in the Medicare claims files. In some instances these variables are different across the different claims files. ResDAC provides (upon request) several different worksheets which describe which variables found in the claims files need to be aggregated to obtain the payment to a provider. The following table provides links to these tables. Some care should be taken when applying these definitions to the older claims files as these files are created for the most recent files.

The NBER SAS extraction code extracts information for index events at the line item level because it allows researchers to dis-aggregate costs and other information at the smallest level possible. However, some variables are only available on the claims for a group of associated 'line items'. In these cases the code merges claim level information to the line item level, creating some redundancy.  In calculating reimbursements (according to correspondence with ResDAC) users can sum variables which covers payments from the 3 entities described in the previous section, see ResDAC documentation. The documentation recommends using the line allowed charge amount ( lalowchg ) in order to get a measure of total reimbursement. The latter is used in the cost programs because it is available for all years (see  stayCost  variable).

Note that the program looks to estimates all-payment received by the provider , equal to all payment made from the three groups  MEDICARE REIMB + BENE PAYMENT + SECONDARY PAY . Embedded in the code, comments document the exact variables used to generate a measure of spending.  The code assumed that costs in claims are linear over time in the case where a length of stay is longer then the  X  days cost metric being constructed. For example if a claim started on the 26 th  day after the index event and lasted through the 35 th  day after the index event, 30 days costs would include 50%  ((30-26+1)/(35-26+1)) ((30-26+1)/(35-26+1))  of the associated costs for that claim.  In addition to information on the actual amount a provider is payed, the bill or charge amount a provider sends to Medicare is also available in the claims files.

In order to do so an understanding of the different payment systems is needed. The following subsections will be broken down by Medicare claim type (MedPAR, Carrier or Outpatient), each section will review the different payment systems found within each claim file noting that not all payment systems have a cost-utilization measure created for them. Each section will provide an overview of the payment systems found in each claim file and will close with describing how the cost utilization measure for the given payment system is constructed in the code.  Generally, each payment system follows a similar formula where a weight, assigned to the care received, describes the intensity of care relative to some average level of care. However converting this level of care into a dollar amount requires a base dollar amount CMS refers to as a conversion factor, which is updated annually. The weight and conversion factor determine the reimbursement a provider receives for the services rendered to a patient, however their are additional multipliers or add-ons specific to different payment systems which compensate a provider for non-utilization characteristics.  One notable exception exists for these payment systems exists in the case of Maryland.  1  The programs presented in this section do not attempt to account for Maryland specific reimbursement rules or exclude claims occurring in Maryland. Researchers should be aware of this issue.  As a general rule of thumb, users looking for more in-depth descriptions of payment systems should first check the MedPAC site for information regarding reimbursement systems, then look through CMS published final rules and finally move onto the internet-only manuals (IOM). Each resource goes into much more detail then the previous and its advisable to try to get a top down understanding before moving into too fine of detail on the reimbursement systems. It is worth noting that while the formulas appear straightforward, in practice they may lack many important details. In order to truly capture the reimbursement system with greater accuracy would in some cases involve a level of granularity which is difficult to attain. Furthermore, the changing reimbursement policies over time would also need to be replicated. With these warning in mind, the following section provides an overview of how the current reimbursement systems function. Information on final rules as well as a short overview of the different formulas CMS uses in calculating the reimbursement are discussed. In addition to the final rules, a direct link to the current regulations is available  here .  Finally, users looking to run the  costutilization  programs should note that there are several SAS programs which provide the cost utilization code, however the structure is different then some of the other programs included in the main extraction portion of the code. All programs used are controlled by a master program which calls all of the subprograms for the different reimbursement systems. The program is called  CallAllCostUtilizationPrgms.sas .

The first major difference is that the Dartmouth index only goes back to 2003 and is only made available at the state and HRR level. The geographic level of aggregation would not be adequate in studies concentrating on provider level outcomes. The index is also aggregated across several different payment systems which may or may not be a problem for some studies. However, the largest difference between these measures is in how Dartmouth multiplies their index by a constant every year to ensure that cost utilization measures equal total cost.

The PPS established excludes children and cancer hospitals, as well as hospitals located outside of the 50 states. In addition, the statute allows for other exclusions like hospitals that are covered under state reimbursement control systems. These hospitals are paid on the basis of reasonable costs (IOM, Chapter 3 Inpatient Billing, Section 20).  Provider numbers 21000-21099 in Maryland are paid 94% of submitted charges subject to any unmet Part B deductible and coinsurance. (IOM, Chapter 3 Inpatient Billing, Section 20).

DRGs are assigned on discharge from an inpatient facility and are therefore associated with a specific stay (not claim). Since they are assigned on discharge the MedPAR and Inpatient files can be thought of as being equivalent when summarizing DRGs for an associated event.  CMS reimbursement calculations begin with an adjusted base labor  B_h^L B_h^L  and non-labor  B_h^{NL} B_h^{NL}  amount. These base amounts depend on whether the location of the  h h th hospital has an associated wage index which is less then or greater than 1. Next a geographic wage adjustment is applied to the  B_h^L B_h^L  in the form of a wage index dependent on the location of the hospital. Once the  B_h^L B_h^L  is adjusted,  B_h^{NL} B_h^{NL}  is added to it a series of policy adjustments scale the reimbursement amount for different hospital specific factors. Finally this scaled amount is further multiplied by the DRG weight. The process is applied to both operating and capital amounts. Note that in the case of the capital amount it is adjusted by a geographic adjustment (GAF),  W_h^K W_h^K , which is not equal to the wage index used in the operating amount.",

However as part of the maintenance of the PFS, the American Medical Association (AMA) offered to take on the role of updating the PFS to account for differences in payment structures and began to do so in 1992 as part of the 5-year maintenance review. Conversion factors are updated annually to account for increases in cost, where as RVU weights are updated annually to account for new codes with a more general review occuring every five-years, is a more in depth review which looks to make sure that the RVU weights keep pace with changes in the way medicine is practiced.  Historically, the RVU where calculated using charges from past claims, although beginning in 1999 the transition from a charge based to a resource based RVU methodology was fully implemented in 2002. The following provides a brief overview of the general formula CMS uses to calculate reimbursements. For further information refer to the IOM, CMS published final rules or  this MedPAC document .  The physician fee schedule maps HCPCS codes to relative value unit ( RVU RVU ) weights associated with three different costs associated with physician providing care. Practice expense RVUs (  RVU^{PE} RVU^{PE}  ) capture the costs associated with renting office space, buying supplies and hiring non-physician clinical and administrative staff. Work RVUs (  RVU^W RVU^W ) capture the costs associated with physicians time for providing a service to a patient. Professional liability insurance RVUs (  RVU^{PLI} RVU^{PLI} ) capture the costs associated with the premium a physician pays for liability insurance. As the following formula shows, each of these components are adjusted by a specific geographic practice cost index ( GPCI GPCI ) relevant to each component. Note that the RVU weights are defined for the  l l th line items associated with the  c c th claim and  p p th patients treated at the  h h th hospital.   \nC^{CAR} \\left(\nRVU_{hpcl}^W \\cdot GPCI_h^W +\nRVU_{hpcl}^{PE} \\cdot GPCI_h^{PE} +\nRVU_{hpcl}^{PLI} \\cdot GPCI_h^{PLI}\n\\right)\n+ Policy_h  \nC^{CAR} \\left(\nRVU_{hpcl}^W \\cdot GPCI_h^W +\nRVU_{hpcl}^{PE} \\cdot GPCI_h^{PE} +\nRVU_{hpcl}^{PLI} \\cdot GPCI_h^{PLI}\n\\right)\n+ Policy_h   Once the RVUs have been adjusted for geographic costs and then summed together a conversion factor is used to transform the RVU weights into an associated dollar amount meant to capture the intensity of a specific procedure. Additionally, the physician fee schedule is adjusted based on the whether the physician provides the care in facility or non-facility setting. Finally, line items occurring during or after 2007 use the transitional PE RVU, rather then the implemented PE RVU which is used before 2007.",

The physician fee schedule is identified at the HCPCS code and for some HCPCS code modifiers.

The reason for this disconnect is that not all modifier codes are of importance in determining the amount a code is reimbursed  3 . In order to merge the claims and fee schedule, first merge on calendar year, HCPCS code and modifier code (only the first modifier). For all non matching merges, merge on calendar year and HCPCS code. A small percent of claims is not matched and are dropped from the sample.  For the most part the file weights are updated annually with the exception of certain new technology which is deemed important enough for Medicare to start reimbursement. In order to be able to adapt to these instances, Medicare publishes the fee schedule quarterly. For most purposes using the last quarter, the \"D\" files, will suffice.

Determining the conversion factor in recent years can be tricky because CMS reports conversion factor that the sustainable growth factor (SGR) rule requires, even though congress has voided the rule every year since 2003.  In 2010, the conversion factor and the physician fee schedule were updated halfway through the year.

The OPPS covers the outpatient hospital setting and covers a large amount of the claims in the outpatient claims file but there are still a significant amount of claims which the OPPS does not cover.  Some of the other payment systems/services found in the outpatient file but not covered by OPPS are described in the following list, a more complete description can be found in  AHIMA's Coding and Reimbursement for Hospital Outpatient Services  (the following list is based on the descriptions given there).

See (AHIMA, 2005) for examples.  Outpatients services furnished to SNF Inpatients : If the care is part of their comprehensive care plan then SNF PPS covers these costs  Inpatient Procedures : procedures which CMS will only reimburse if they have occurred in an inpatient setting. CMS chooses these procedures because the it is not appropriate to preform them in an outpatients setting or because they are almost done in an inpatient setting. Inpatients of a Skilled Nursing Facility. See AHIMA documents for a full list of criteria CMS uses.

For example, a researchers studying heart attacks and looking at 3 day costs will see that the ambulatory fee schedule plays an important role in describing total costs, and therefore the cost utilization metric created below, which only covers the OPPS, will miss a large portion of costs.

Over the next 14 years a series of different regulations were passed which prepared the the outpatient system for a PPS. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provided the implementation for such a system beginning January 1,1999. The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 made further changes to the impending OPPS system. However due to the concern around the Y2K computer bug, the implementation was pushed back to late 2000.(AHIMA, 2005).  Before the OPPS was implemented in late 2000, the outpatient claims were reimbursed using a charge based method, a fee-schedule or some blend of the two. The use of provider specific charges complicates estimating a utilization specific cost amount because geographic and provider specific differences in treatment and billing are mixed in the charges, leaving the researcher with the task of developing a method for separating the two. The methods discuses in the following section for separating policy adjustments from utilization costs are not valid for pre-OPPS data and is not covered by the methods discussed here. For more information about the OPPS and the the reimbursement systems used before the implementation of OPPS in the Outpatient files refer to the following RAND documentWynn (2005) . The remainder of the section will focus on the OPPS which was implemented in 2001.  An outpatient claim can be reimbursed through more then one Medicare payment system because Medicare reimburses for services in the outpatient files at the revenue center level, not the claim level. Since medicare reimburses at the revenue center levels, generating a cost utilization measure specific to a Medicare payment system requires working with costs and procedures codes (HCPCS) at the revenue center level.  The OPPS is reviewed in the following sections, broadly characterizing how reimbursements are calculated. The sections will describe specific aspects of the OPPS like identifying which claims fall under the OPPS and which do not. The OPPS analog to the Inpatient PPS DRGs are the ambulatory patient groups (APCs), a brief overview of APCs are also provided.

They apply a wage index associated with where the hospital is located,W Lh , to the labor portion of the conversion factor which depends on the specific hospital's geography. Next the adjusted conversion factor is multiplied by the APC weight. The conversion factor transforms the APC weight into a dollar amount. The last step is to add in any additional policy adjustments related to hospital specific characteristic,  Policy_h Policy_h . For more information see MedPAC's OPPS payment basics documentation and CMS Internet Only Manuals (IOM).  Note that the COPPS is updated on an annual basis in the OPPS Final Rule. The annual uprate is based on the inpatients market basket percentage increase applicable to hospital discharges and further adjusted to ensure budget neutrality.  While the reimbursement equation is fairly straightforward, there are various different rules which determine how exactly a procedure is reimbursed. The first complication involves determining which claims are covered by OPPS. The \"status indicator\" does this by classifying claims into categories explaining how they are reimbursed.  There are various places where the status indicator is available. The outpatient claims have a status indicator variable. CMS also publishes an annual HCPCs to APC crosswalk in the final rule under Addendum B. The crosswalk is useful in that it also includes status indicator codes as well as copayment amounts for every HCPCS code.  Coinsurance is another major portion of the OPPS which may be of interest in determining total costs. As of 2005, the standard 20% Medicare copayment amount was gradually applied to the OPPS copayment rates. For certain APC groups with a relatively high copayment compared to total payment, the policy was particularly worrisome for some outpatient facilities. As a result, CMS has established national copayment amount for each APC, as well as a minimum or floor price (equal to 20% of total payment). Hospitals are allowed to set the copayment amount between these two rates once a year and advertise these reduced rates. Note prior to the OPPS, coinsurance rates were based on charges not the actual amount reimbursed which lead to coinsurance rates making up a large portion of the total payment to providers.  In some cases, the OPPS has changed the way it reimburses for services which were qualified to receive transitional pass through payments, certain drugs which meet a cost threshold and for new technology where no charge/cost data is available to assign it to an APC. In most of these cases no relative weight is assigned to the appropriate HCPCS code in Addendum A or B. Instead a dollar amount is simply stated for that payment amount.     Payment Type  Description      discount eligible HCPCS  Discount applied if several HCPCS codes which are eligible for a discount appear on the same revenue center.    pass-through payments HCPCS  Implemented to ensure the transition to OPPS did not adversely impact providers, pass-through payments set to expire.

A status indicator is mapped to the claims files through the use Addendum B which is part of every final rule. The file is basically a crosswalk between HCPCS codes and APC codes with all of the relevant information.  Note that the outpatient claims have a variable \u201capchipps\u201c which should provide an APC for each revenue center observation. However in practice I have found that these variables are not very consistent with what is found in Addendum B. More specifically, the APCs found in  apchipps  and those found by merging Addendum B only have 60% correlation between 2001 and 2008. Looking at the annual correlations shows extremely inconsistent results. In addition, CMS also includes a variable for status indicators -  pmtmthd  - which shows several different status indicators for APCs found in  apchipps . It appears that  apchipps  has a large majority of claims with a  0000  code which indicates that these revenue centers have been packaged \u2014 a  N  status indicator.  Addendum B is the key file necessary for identifying outpatient claims covered by the OPPS and also for defining the associated payment weight or payment amount for each APC. The file need only be merged with the HCPCS codes, a crosswalk from HCPCS code to relevant APC code, weight and payment rate. These files are used with the code provided for the OPPS to map HCPCS codes to APCs and status indicators.  In addition to Addendum B, the final rule published annually provides a complete description of the reimbursement changes in it entirety. Of specific interest are the conversion factors, COPPS 4\u2191, which are published annually in the final rules. However some caution needs to be used to ensure that the last final rule is used as they often go through several revisions which can be major 7 .  Starting in 2009 CMS implemented the Hospital Outpatient Quality Data Reporting Program, which granted outpatient hospitals successfully reporting quality measures an additional reimbursement in the form of a higher conversion factor. We decided to use the unadjusted (reduced) conversion factor in the 2009 and 2010 years because our interest is in cost utilization, not in the added incentives in place.

            "text": "A SAS program is included in the pack at  CombineOPclms_revcenter.sas  to combine the claims and revenue center items. Next Addendum B is merged in with the HCPCS codes found in the outpatient file. Note that due to copyright restrictions placed on CPT codes used in Addendum B, the APCS weights are not redistributed as part of this code. Users need to download them from the CMS website.  In addition to importing Addendum B into a SAS file, the program also goes through and groups the HCPCS codes using the associated status indicator variables found in Addendum B into four categories indicated by the  costutiltype  variable. The following section describes how the cost-utilization measure is constructed for each group.\n\"Other payment system\" HCPCS codes ( costutiltype = 0 )  As already discussed, the outpatient files have several different payment systems which reimburse revenue center claims. While the OPPS is the largest reimbursement system, this category deals with the costs which are not covered by the OPPS. It is defined as HCPCS code with an associated status indicator (variable name  si ) not in ( G ,  H ,  K , S , P , Q , T , V , X , N ). No cost adjustment is made of these type of claims and costs are used as is.\n\"Standard weight\" HCPCS codes ( costutiltype = 1 )  HCPCS codes with a \"standard weight\" describe HCPCS codes for which a relative APC weight exists. Calculating cost-utilization measure for these claims is straightforward for the most part, with the exception of discounted claims discussed next. For non-discounted claims, the cost-utilization measure is calculated as follows\n(6.9) costutil\u2005=\u2005COPPS\u22c6APChhpcr  One measure constructed  outpatient_Q , ignore the discounting discused next and basically applies equation 9 to all the relevant claims. There are a handful of cases whose status indicator falls into this group but for which there are no relative weights or payment rates for these groups. These claims have a missing value assigned to the variables. The majority of these revenue centers do not report costs in the claims files.  The standard weight group also includes HCPCS codes which are eligible for a discount, indicated by a status indicator  T  code or by the  discountPossilbe  dummy variable. A discount only occurs if several HCPCS codes which are eligible for a discount appear on the same claim. In these cases, the APC weight is discounted per the OPPS rules which indicate that of all  T  HCPCS codes, the code with the max weight is reimbursed in full and the remaining HCPCS codes are reimbursed at 50% of the APC weight. The adjusted weight is stored in the  updatewght  variable and the unadjusted weight is stored in the  relwght  variable. These are coded into the program as outpatient_QTcode to allow user to compare the cost-utilization measures.\n\"Standard pay amount\" HCPCS codes ( costutiltype = 2 )\n\"Standard pay amount\" HCPCS codes have no relative weight, but do have a dollar amount associated with them which are still adjusted for geography. New technology is eligible to apply for pass-though status. In addition when technology first enters the OPPS, it is assigned to and APC within a given cost band. No relative weight is associated with this APC because not enough claims data has been collected for the given technology. As more information is gathered the technology is moved from the new technology cost band and placed in an appropriate APC category.  The new technology appears to be geographically adjusted upon comparison in the claims files. The new technology APCS are between the following number 0970-0997 before 2004, 1501 to 1574 between 2004 and 2005 and 1492 to 1574 in 2006 and beyond. . In these instances no estimated conversion factor is used, rather the payment rate amount found on Addendum B is used.\n(6.10) costutil\u2005=\u2005payamount OPPShpcr\n\"unadjusted payment\" HCPCS codes ( costutiltype = 3 )  Some HCPCS codes are \"unadjusted\" and cover prescription drugs and some pass-through payments. Prescription drugs are based on wholesale index and not wage adjusted. Some pass-through amounts are included in this category, however pass-through payments lie in a grayer area then prescription drugs in the sense that they are often cost-based, which means that their maybe some implicit geographic variation in these amounts. Codes falling into this category are not adjusted for cost utilization, some examples include new technology which is eligible for pass-through status. The actual amount reimbursed is used.  Initially prescription drugs were assigned there own relative weights in Addendum A and Addendum B, however in 2004 the PDMI was passed which changed the way in which reimbursement were calculated. Drugs which crossed a cost threshold were reimbursed according to the average sales price.  Prescription drugs do not receive a wage index adjustment but their administration does because they are coded and reimbursed separately. In addition prescription drugs do not receive an adjustment for a rural location. Note that the administration of a drug does not fall in this category.  This paper  provides a good overview of recent changes. Note that the payment for drugs are not adjusted\n$$\ncost_{util} = fullreimb_{reported}^{OPPS}\n$$\n\u201cPackaged Incidental service\u201c ( costutiltype = 4 )  These are revenue centers with a status indicator of  N  which means that their costs have been packaged into other revenue centers observations. Addendum B provides no relative weights for these HCPCS codes and in many cases these correspond to revenue centers found in the claims files with no HCPCS code. These are identified by using the status indicator variable  pmtmthd  found in the claims files. In some cases the claims do have an associated cost for the given, revenue centers. These costs are ignored in the  outpatient_Q  variable, its set to missing, because these costs are assumed to be some non-utilization costs as the documentation would suggest. Nonetheless this separate group is defined in the case an individual is interested in further looking into this group.\n$$\ncost_{util} = fullreimb_{reported}^{OPPS}\n$$\n\u201cInconsistent HCPCS codes \u201c ( costutiltype = 5 )  These codes are inconsistent in the sense that the revenue center claims files  pmtmthd  indicator variables denotes these claims as being covered by OPPS although their is no match for the HCPCS code in Addendum B. Closer inspection of the HCPCS codes shows that they are mostly C and G HCPCS codes. The C codes are temporary HCPCS codes and the G codes are for voluntary reporting of quality codes. This group makes up less then 1% of the claims and the total unadjusted costs are included in the  outpatient_Q  measures.\n$$\ncost_{util} = fullreimb_{reported}\n$$\n\u201cNo map from HCPCS codes to status indicator\u201c ( costutiltype = 6 )  These HCPCS codes have no status indicator in the claims files and also do not match to Addendum B and are therefore unsure how to deal with these claims. This group is only a handful of claims and is mostly made of HCPCS X codes. The total unadjusted costs are included in the  outpatient_Q  measures.\n$$\ncost_{util} = fullreimb_{reported}\n$$",

The 1998 rule proposed to rebase the ASC payment rates using cost, charge, and utilization data collected by a 1994 survey of ASCs. In that proposed rule, we also proposed to refine the rate setting methodology that was implemented in the February 8, 1990 Federal Register\u00a0 \u21a9    The APCs were created by 3M-Health Information Systems using a sample of Medicare outpatient claims. Using these claims, 3M aggregated codes into clinically related groupings which are also similar in cost intensiveness. For a more in-depth review of the particulars of how the APCs are constructed and the specific criteria used to create APC groups refer to AHIMA's Coding and Reimbursement for Hospital Outpatient Services.\nEach APC is assigned a relative weight which represents the intensity of a specified treatment. The relative weights use a mid-level clinic visit (APC 601) as the denominator because it is one of the most frequently preformed services.\u00a0 \u21a9    One year Addendum B was miscalculated due to a programming error\u00a0 \u21a9",

After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to re- ceive any currently issued UPINs.

NPIs will replace the current legacy numbers (UPINs, PINs, etc.) on the standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number.\n\n\nCMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system maintainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy number) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and Outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.\n\n\nCarrier Line Performing NPI Number\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nPRFNPI\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nPRF_PHYSN_NPI\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nCarrier RIF\n\n\n\n\nA placeholder field (effective with Version H) for storing the NPI assigned to the performing provider.\n\n\nCarrier Line Performing PIN Number\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nPRF_PRFL\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nCARR_PRFRNG_PIN_NUM\n\n\n\n\nVariable Names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2011\n\n\n2010\n\n\n2009\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2007\n\n\n2006\n\n\n2005\n\n\n2004\n\n\n2003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2002\n\n\n2001\n\n\n2000\n\n\n1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\nprf_prfl\n\n\nbcpppn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nCarrier RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe profiling identification number (PIN) of the physician\\supplier (assigned by the carrier) who performed the service for this line item on the carrier claim (non-DMERC).\n\n\nCarrier Line Performing Provider ZIP Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nPROVZIP\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nPRVDR_ZIP\n\n\n\n\nVariable Names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2011\n\n\n2010\n\n\n2009\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2007\n\n\n2006\n\n\n2005\n\n\n2004\n\n\n2003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2002\n\n\n2001\n\n\n2000\n\n\n1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\nprovzip\n\n\nbppzip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nCarrier RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe ZIP code of the physician/supplier who performed the Part B service for this line item on the carrier claim (non-DMERC).\n\n\nCarrier Line Performing UPIN Number\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nPRF_UPIN\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nPRF_PHYSN_UPIN\n\n\n\n\nVariable Names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2011\n\n\n2010\n\n\n2009\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2007\n\n\n2006\n\n\n2005\n\n\n2004\n\n\n2003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2002\n\n\n2001\n\n\n2000\n\n\n1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\nprf_upin\n\n\nblnppun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nCarrier RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe unique physician identification number (UPIN) of the physician who performed the service for this line item on the carrier claim (non-DMERC).\n\n\nLimitation\nREFER TO :\n CARR_LINE_PRFRMG_UPIN_LIM\nCarrier Line Pricing Locality Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nLCLTY_CD\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nCARR_LINE_PRCNG_LCLTY_CD\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nCarrier RIF\n\n\n\n\nCode denoting the carrier-specific locality used for pricing the service for this line item on the carrier claim (non-DMERC).\n\n\nCarrier Line Provider Type Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nPRV_TYPE\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nCARR_LINE_PRVDR_TYPE_CD\n\n\n\n\nVariable Names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2011\n\n\n2010\n\n\n2009\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2007\n\n\n2006\n\n\n2005\n\n\n2004\n\n\n2003\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2002\n\n\n2001\n\n\n2000\n\n\n1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\nprv_type\n\n\nbprvtyp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nCarrier RIF\n\n\n\n\nCode identifying the type of provider furnishing the service for this line item on the carrier claim (non-DMERC).\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\nFor Physician/Supplier (RIC O) Claims:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nClinics, groups, associations, partnerships, or other entities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nPhysicians or suppliers reporting as solo practitioners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nSuppliers (other than sole proprietorship)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nInstitutional provider\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nIndependent laboratories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nClinics (multiple specialties)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nGroups (single specialty)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nOther entities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor DMERC (RIC M) Claims -

See the CARR_NUM table of codes to identify the new MAC numbers and their effective dates.\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\nCarrier Number-MAC Table.txt \n\n\nCataract End-of-Year Flag\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nCATARACT\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMaster Beneficiary Summary File\n\n\n\n\nThis code specifies whether the beneficiary met the chronic condition algorithm criteria within the specified reference period.\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nNeither claims nor coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nClaims met, coverage not met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nClaims not met, coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nClaims and coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCataract Mid-Year Flag\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nCATARCTM\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMaster Beneficiary Summary File\n\n\n\n\nThis code specifies whether the beneficiary met the chronic condition algorithm criteria on July 1 of the specified reference period.\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nNeither claims nor coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nClaims met, coverage not met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nClaims not met, coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nClaims and coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCerebral Palsy End-of-Year Indicator - Medicare Only Claims\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nCERPAL_MEDICARE\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMaster Beneficiary Summary File\n\n\n\n\nThis variable indicates whether a beneficiary met the condition criteria for cerebral palsy as of the end of the calendar year.\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\nThe condition variable requires beneficiaries to satisfy both claims criteria (a minimum number/type of Medicare claims that have the proper diagnosis codes and occurred within a specified time period) and coverage criteria (Medicare FFS Part A and Part B coverage during the entire specified time period).\n\n\nFor cerebral palsy, beneficiaries must have at least one Medicare inpatient claim or two other non-drug claims of any service type with a related code in any position during the 2-year reference period.

NPIs will replace current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identification numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).\n\n\nNOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs.

The\nclaims received during this timeperiod have no POA indicators.\nThe problem was a result of a defect in the conversion code\nused by CWF to convert the new 5010 record format back to the\n4010 format for the NCH. The reason CWF was converting the\nclaims to the 4010 format was because they implemented the 5010\nformat beginning in July 2009 but the NCH is still using\nthe 4010 until \u2153/2011.\nCORRECTIVE ACTION:\nCWF will be sending in adjustment claims to correct the\nproblem. The claims will come into the NCH the week of\nDecember 19, 2009. There were approximately 3 million\nclaims missing the POA indicator.CLM_POA_IND_CD_LIM\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nDiagnosis was present at the time of inpatient admission.

NPIs will replace the current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identi- fication numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).\n\n\nNOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy number and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system maint- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when its adjudicated. We will continue to re- ceive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy numbers) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.\n\n\nClaim Operating Physician Specialty Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nOP_PHYSN_SPCLTY_CD\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nOP_PHYSN_SPCLTY_CD\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nSkilled Nursing Facility RIF\n\n\nOutpatient RIF\n\n\nInpatient RIF\n\n\nHospice RIF\n\n\nHome Health Agency RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe code used to identify the CMS specialty code corresponding to the operating physician.

NPIs will replace current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identification numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).\n\n\nNOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy number) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B AND outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.\n\n\nClaim Other Physician Specialty Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nOT_PHYSN_SPCLTY_CD\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nOT_PHYSN_SPCLTY_CD\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nSkilled Nursing Facility RIF\n\n\nOutpatient RIF\n\n\nInpatient RIF\n\n\nHospice RIF\n\n\nHome Health Agency RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe code used to identify the CMS specialty code corresponding to the other physician.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides for incentive payments for physicians and non-physician practitioners with specific primary specialty designations.

Generally, the amount is calculated by the FI or carrier; and represents what was paid to the institutional provider, physician, or supplier, with the exceptions noted below. **NOTE: In some situations, a negative claim payment amount may be pre- sent; e.g., (1) when a beneficiary is charged the full deductible during a short stay and the deductible exceeded the amount Medicare pays; or (2) when a beneficiary is charged a coinsurance amount during a long stay and the coinsurance amount exceeds the amount Medicare pays (most prevalent situation involves psych hospitals who are paid a daily per diem rate no matter what the charges are.)\n\n\nUnder IP PPS, inpatient hospital services are paid based on a predetermined rate per discharge, using the DRG patient classification system and the PRICER program. On the IP PPS claim, the payment amount includes the DRG outlier approved payment amount, disproportionate share (since 5/1/86), indirect medical education (since 10/1/88), total PPS capital (since 10/1/91). After 4/1/03, the payment amount could also include a \"new technology\" add-on amount. It does NOT include the pass-thru amounts (i.e., capital- related costs, direct medical education costs, kidney acquisition costs, bad debts); or any beneficiary-paid amounts (i.e., deductibles and coinsurance); or any any other payer reimbursement.\n\n\nUnder IRFPPS, inpatient rehabilitation services are paid based on a predetermined rate per discharge, using the Case Mix Group (CMG) classification system and the PRICER program. From the CMG on the IRF PPS claim, payment is based on a standard payment amount for operating and capital cost for that facility (including routine and ancillary services). The payment is adjusted for wage, the % of low-income patients (LIP), locality, transfers, interrupted stays, short stay cases, deaths, and high cost outliers. Some or all of these adjustments could apply. The CMG payment does NOT include certain pass- through costs (i.e. bad debts, approved education activities); beneficiary-paid amounts, other payer reim- bursement,and other services outside of the scope of PPS.\n\n\nUnder LTCH PPS, long term care hospital services are paid based on a predetermined rate per discharge based on the DRG and the PRICER program. Payments are based on a single standard Federal rate for both inpatient operating and capital-related costs (including routine and ancillary services), but do NOT include certain pass-through costs (i.e. bad debts, direct medical education, new technologies and blood clotting factors). Adjustments to the payment may occur due to short-stay outliers, interrupted stays, high cost outliers, wage index, and cost of living adjust- ments.\n\n\nUnder SNF PPS, SNFs will classify beneficiaries using the patient classification system known as RUGS III. For the SNF PPS claim, the SNF PRICER will calculate/return the rate for each revenue center line item with revenue center code = \n0022\n; multiply the rate times the units count; and then sum the amount payable for all lines with revenue center code \n0022\n to determine the total claim payment amount.\n\n\nUnder Outpatient PPS, the national ambulatory payment classification (APC) rate that is calculated for each APC group is the basis for determining the total claim payment. The payment amount also includes the outlier payment and interest.\n\n\nUnder Home Health PPS, beneficiaries will be classified into an appropriate case mix category known as the Home Health Resource Group. A HIPPS code is then generated corresponding to the case mix category (HHRG).\n\n\nFor the RAP, the PRICER will determine the payment amount appropriate to the HIPPS code by computing 60% (for first episode) or 50% (for subsequent episodes) of the case mix episode payment. The payment is then wage index adjusted.\n\n\nFor the final claim, PRICER calculates 100% of the amount due, because the final claim is processed as an adjustment to the RAP, reversing the RAP payment in full. Although final claim will show 100% payment amount, the provider will actually receive the 40% or 50% payment. The payment may also include outlier payments.\n\n\nExceptions: For claims involving demos and BBA encounter data, the amount reported in this field may not just represent the actual provider payment.\n\n\nFor demo Ids \n01\n,\n02\n,\n03\n,\n04\n -- claims contain amount paid to the provider, except that special 'differentials' paid outside the normal payment system are not included.\n\n\nFor demo Ids \n05\n,\n15\n -- encounter data 'claims' contain amount Medicare would have paid under FFS, instead of the actual payment to the MCO.\n\n\nFor demo Ids \n06\n,\n07\n,\n08\n -- claims contain actual provider payment but represent a special negotiated bundled payment for both Part A and Part B services. To identify what the conventional provider Part A payment would have been, check value code = \nY4\n. The related noninstitutional (physician/supplier) claims contain what would have been paid had there been no demo.\n\n\nFor BBA encounter data (non-demo) -- 'claims' contain amount Medicare would have paid under FFS, instead of the actual payment to the BBA plan.\n\n\nLimitation\nPrior to 4/6/93, on inpatient, outpatient, and\n physician/supplier claims containing a\n CLM_DISP_CD of '02', the amount shown as the Medicare\n reimbursement does not take into consideration\n any CWF automatic adjustments (involving erroneous\n deductibles in most cases).  In as many as 30% of\n the claims (30% IP, 15% OP, 5% PART B), the\n reimbursement reported on the claims may be over\n or under the actual Medicare payment amount.\nREFER TO :\n PMT_AMT_EXCEDG_CHRG_AMT_LIM\nClaim Pricer Return Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nCLM_PRCR_RTRN_CD\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nCLM_PRCR_RTRN_CD\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient RIF\n\n\nInpatient RIF\n\n\nHospice RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe code used to identify various prospective payment system (PPS) payment adjustment types.

This field is redundant with revenue center code 0001/total charges.\n\n\nLimitation\nDESCRIPTION :\nThe total charge amount field in the fixed portion was\ntruncated on outpatient, hospice and home health claims.\nBACKGROUND :\nFor outpatient, hospice and home health claims, the\ntotal charge amount field in the fixed portion was\ntruncated (the cents were dropped off; the decimal\npoint was moved, making cents out of dollars) in the\nCWFMQA process beginning with data received from CWF\n\u00bc/99 through 5/14/99. The problem occurred when\nCWF increased the size of the field.\nCORRECTIVE ACTION :\nThe CWFMQA front-end was fixed. The Nearline was patched during the quarterly merge in 7/99 for service years 1998 and 1999. The NCH_PACTCH_CD field will be populated with a value '11'. The 1998 and 1999 SAFs were corrected when finalized in 7/99. The patch involved moving the total charge amount in the revenue center trailer to the total charge amount field in the fixed portion, for records with NCH Daily Process Date \u00bc/99 - 5/14/99.\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXXX.XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim Total PPS Capital Amount\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nPPS_CPTL\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nCLM_TOT_PPS_CPTL_AMT\n\n\n\n\nVariable Names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2013\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2011\n\n\n2010\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2008\n\n\n2007\n\n\n2006\n\n\n2005\n\n\n2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2003\n\n\n2002\n\n\n2001\n\n\n2000\n\n\n1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\nmppscamt\n\n\nmppscamt\n\n\nmppscamt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n1998\n\n\n1997\n\n\n1996\n\n\n1995\n\n\n1994\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\nmppscamt\n\n\nmppscamt\n\n\nmppscamt\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n1993\n\n\n1992\n\n\n1991\n\n\n1990\n\n\n1989\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\npps_cptl\n\n\nmppscamt\n\n\nmppscamt\n\n\nmppscamt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n1988\n\n\n1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\nmppscamt\n\n\nmppscamt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nInpatient RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe total amount that is payable for capital PPS for the claim.

The percentages change each FY.  \n\n\nAdditional information is available on the CMS \"Hospital Value-Based Purchasing\" website. \n\n\nThe actual dollar amount of the adjustment that applied to the claim is found in the variable called CLM_VBP_ADJSTMT_PMT_AMT.\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX.XX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim Value Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nVAL_CD\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nCLM_VAL_CD\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nSkilled Nursing Facility RIF\n\n\nOutpatient RIF\n\n\nInpatient RIF\n\n\nHospice RIF\n\n\nHome Health Agency RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe code indicating the value of a monetary condition which was used by the intermediary to process an institutional claim.\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\nClaim Value Table.txt \n\n\nClaim Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Participant Indicator Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nCLM_VBP_PRTCPNT_IND_CD\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nCLM_VBP_PRTCPNT_IND_CD\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nInpatient RIF\n\n\n\n\nThis field is the code used to identify a reason a hospital is excluded from the Hospital Value Based Purchasing (HVBP) program.\n\n\nThe ACA (Section 3001) excludes from the HVBP hospitals that meet certain conditions.\nAdditional information is available on the CMS \"Hospital Value-Based Purchasing\" website.\nThis initiative began in 4\nth\n Quarter of 2013 (i.e., beginning of Federal fiscal year 14).\nThis field was new in 2013, and is null/missing for all previous years.\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nY\n\n\nParticipating in Hospital Value Based Purchasing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n\nNot participating in Hospital Value Based Purchasing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull/missing\n\n\nsame as 'N'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaim service facility ZIP code (where service was provided)\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nCLM_SRVC_FAC_ZIP_CD\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nCLM_SRVC_FAC_ZIP_CD\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient RIF\n\n\nInpatient RIF\n\n\nHospice RIF\n\n\n\n\nZIP code where service was provided, as indicated on the claim.\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXXXXXXXXX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments monitored laboratory number\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nCARR_LINE_CLIA_LAB_NUM\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nCARR_LINE_CLIA_LAB_NUM\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nCarrier RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe identification number assigned to the clinical laboratory providing services for the line item on the carrier claim (non-DMERC).\n\n\nClinical Trial Number\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nCCLTRNUM\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nCLM_CLNCL_TRIL_NUM\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nDurable Medical Equipment RIF\n\n\nCarrier RIF\n\n\n\n\nEffective September 1, 2008 with the implementation of CR#3, the number used to identify all items and services provided to a beneficiary during their participation in a clinical trial.\n\n\nNOTE: CMS is requesting the clinical trial number be voluntarily reported.

After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system maintainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and Outpatient claims) so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those phy- sicians.\n\n\nDMERC Line Miles/Time/Units/Services Count\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nDME_UNIT\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nDMERC_LINE_MTUS_CNT\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\nThe count of the total units associated with the DMERC line item service needing unit reporting, including number of services, volume of oxygen and drug dose.\n\n\nDMERC Line Miles/Time/Units/Services Indicator Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nUNIT_IND\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nDMERC_LINE_MTUS_CD\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\nCode indicating the units associated with services needing unit reporting on the line item for the DMERC service.\u00a0\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nValues reported as zero\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n(rarely used)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n(rarely used)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nNumber of services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nOxygen volume units\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nDrug dosage (valid 2004 and earlier) - Since early 1994 this value has incorrectly been placed on DMERC claims.

The codes are divided into three levels, or groups as described below.\n\n\nIn the Institutional Claim Revenue Center Files, this variable can indicate the specific case-mix grouping that Medicare used to pay for skilled nursing facility (SNF), home health, or inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) services (see Note 2 below).\n\n\nLevel I\n\n\nCodes and descriptors copyrighted by the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition (CPT-4). These are 5-position numeric codes representing physician and non-physician services.\n\n\n* Note 1: \n* CPT-4 codes including both long and short descriptions shall be used in accordance with the CMS/AMA agreement. Any other use violates the AMA copyright.\n\n\nLevel II\n\n\nIncludes codes and descriptors copyrighted by the American Dental Association's Current Dental Terminology, Fifth Edition (CDT-5). These are 5-position alpha-numeric codes comprising the D series. All other level II codes and descriptors are approved and maintained jointly by the alpha- numeric editorial panel (consisting of CMS, the Health Insurance Association of America, and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association). These are 5-position alpha-numeric codes representing primarily items and non-physician services that are not represented in the level I codes.\n\n\nLevel III\n\n\nCodes and descriptors developed by Medicare carriers (currently known as Medicare Administrative Contractors; MACs) for use at the local (MAC) level. These are 5-position alpha-numeric codes in the W, X, Y or Z series representing physician and non-physician services that are not represented in the level I or level II codes.\n\n\n* Note 2: \n*\n\n\nThis field may contain information regarding case-mix grouping that Medicare used to pay for SNF, home health, or IRF services.

Users of the regular unencrypted MEDPAR file, this is not a problem, as the count can be calculated using the admission date and the date of death.  The problem is with the encrypted file (the expanded modified MEDPAR) because the fields needed to calculate the mortality days are ranged.\nCORRECTIVE ACTION :\nThe problem was corrected with the 12/00 MEDPAR update.

They discovered that the blood deductible amount on the new MEDPAR was greater than that of the old MEDPAR.\nDuring NCH's investigation it was determined that the old 500-character MEDPAR incorrectly used a different field to report the blood deductible; specifically the noncovered\ncharges derived from blood use Revenue Center codes 0380-0389.  The new program correctly used the NCH field, BENE_BLOOD_DDCTBL_LBLTY_AMT, which is derived from a value code (CLM_VAL_AMT associated with CLM_VAL_CD = '6').\nIt is believed that all MEDPAR files created prior to 6/95 in the 500 character version are affected. MEDPAR 500 was first available with calendar year and fiscal year 9/91 updates for year 1987 forward.\nNOTE:  This anamoly also impacts the DRG Price Amount on the old MEDPAR file because it is calculated from a number of fields including the blood deductible.\nMEDPAR Beneficiary Death Date\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nDEATHDT\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe date the beneficiary died.\n\n\nDerivation\nThis field comes from the beneficiary death date, if present on the enrollment database, which is accessed prior to creation of the quarterly MEDPAR file.\nLimitation\nDESCRIPTION :\nThe Date of Death on the MEDPAR files were not up-to-date for four cycles.\nBACKGROUND  :\n The MEDPAR process pulls in 10 segments of the HISKEW file, to get the date of death.  The HISKEW file names were changed with no notification the change was being made.  Because of this, MEDPAR kept using the HISKEW that was created in June 2000.\nThe incomplete MEDPAR cycles are: 12/2000, 3/2001,  6/2001 and 9/2001 (9/2000 MEDPAR was not run).\nCORRECTIVE ACTION

beneficiary coinsurance liability amount, MEDPAR beneficiary Inpatient deductible liability amount, MEDPAR beneficiary blood deductible amount; and then subtracting from the sum the MEDPAR DRG outlier approved payment amount.\nLimitation\nDESCRIPTION :\nIT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE DRG PRICE AMOUNT WSA INCORRECT ON THE OLD MEDPAR FILES.\nBACKGROUND  :\nUsers of the MEDPAR data were comparing money amounts and counts present on the new MEDPAR file (created 6/95 using NCH Nearline File as the source) to that reported on the old MEDPAR File (created 3/95 and prior from claims from the Medicare Quality Assurance System) for Fiscal Year 1994.  They discovered that the DRG price amount on the new MEDPAR contained incorrect amounts.\nNOTE:  This anamoly occurs because the DRG price amount is calculated from a number of fields including the blood deductible amount, which was discovered to be populated incorrectly.\nDuring NCH's investigation it was determined that the old 500-character MEDPAR incorrectly used a different field to report the blood deductible; specifically the noncovered charges derived from blood use Revenue Center codes 0380-0389.  The new program correctly used the NCH field, BENE_BLOOD_DDCTBL_LBLTY_AMT, which is derived from a value code (CLM_VAL_AMT associated with CLM_VAL_CD = '6').\nIt is believed that all MEDPAR files created prior to 6/95 in the 500 character version were affected. MEDPAR 500 was first available with calendar year and fiscal year 9/91  updates for year 1987 forward.\nMEDPAR DRG/Outlier Stay Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nOUTLR_CD\n\n\n\n\nVariable Names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2013\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2011\n\n\n2010\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2008\n\n\n2007\n\n\n2006\n\n\n2005\n\n\n2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2003\n\n\n2002\n\n\n2001\n\n\n2000\n\n\n1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n1998\n\n\n1997\n\n\n1996\n\n\n1995\n\n\n1994\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n1993\n\n\n1992\n\n\n1991\n\n\n1990\n\n\n1989\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\noutlr_cd\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n1988\n\n\n1987\n\n\n1986\n\n\n1985\n\n\n1984\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\nmoutlier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe code identifying (1) for PPS providers if the stay has an unusually long length (day outlier) or high cost (cost outlier); or (2) for non-PPS providers the source for developing the DRG.\n\n\nDerivation\nThis field is the actual DRG outlier stay code that is present on the last claim record included in the stay.\nValues\n\n\n\nApplicable to PPS providers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nNo Outlier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nDay Outlier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nCost Outlier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplicable to Non-PPS Providers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nValid DRG Received From Intermediary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nHCFA-Developed DRG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nHCFA-Developed DRG Using Claim Status Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nNot Groupable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEDPAR Departmental Total Charge Amount\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nDPRTMNTL\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe total charge amount (rounded to whole dollars) for all ancillary departments (other than routine room and board, CCU, and ICU) related to a beneficiary's stay.\n\n\nDerivation\nThis field is derived by accumulating the revenue center total charge amount associated with revenue center codes 0220 - 0999 from all claim records included in the stay (i.e., the sum of charges for all revenue centers other than accommodations 0100 - 0219).\nMEDPAR Diagnosis Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nDGNSCD{x}\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR RIF\n\n\n\n\nThe diagnosis code identifying the beneficiary's principal or other diagnosis (including E code).\n\n\nNOTE: Prior to Version H, the principal diagnosis code was not stored with the 'OTHER' diagnosis codes.

'Post' was removed from the revenue center code 0206 description, effective 10/1/96 (12/96 MEDPAR update). 0206 Is now defined as 'intermediate ICU'.\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nGeneral (revenue center 0200)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nSurgical (revenue center 0201)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nMedical (revenue center 0202)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nPediatric (revenue center 0203)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nPsychiatric (revenue center 0204)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nIntermediate IOU; (revenue center 0209) prior to 12/96 update was 'post ICU'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nBurn care (revenue center 0207)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nTrauma (revenue center 0208)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nOther intensive care (revenue code 0209)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEDPAR Internal Use (By IPSB) Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nIPSBCD\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMedPAR RIF\n\n\n\n\nLimited availability; for internal use only.

Generally, the amount is calculated by the fi; and represents what was paid to the institutional provider, with the exceptions noted below.\n\n\nNOTE: In some situations, a negative claim payment amount may be present; e.g., (1) when a beneficiary is charged the full deductible during a short stay and the deductible exceeded the amount Medicare pays; or (2) when a beneficiary is charged a coinsurance amount during a long stay and the coinsurance amount exceeds the amount Medicare pays (most prevalent situation involves psych hospitals who are paid a daily per diem rate no matter what the charges are.)\n\n\nUnder IP PPS, Inpatient hospital services are paid based on a predetermined rate per discharge, using the DRG patient classification system and the pricer program. On the IP PPS claim, the payment amount includes the DRG outlier approved payment amount, disproportionate share (since 05/1/86), in- direct medical education (since 10/1/88), total PPS capital (since 10/1/91).

Since CANs can change over time (e.g., in the case of remarriage), new beneficiaries are becoming eligible for Medicare, and existing beneficiaries are dying, the sample is cross-sectional.

Those files are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d for identifying dual eligibles because the information in them is used to determine the level of Medicare Part D low-income subsidies. Dual eligibles are often divided into \u201cfull duals\u201d and \u201cpartial duals\u201d based on the level of Medicaid benefits they receive.

NPIs will replace current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identification numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).\n\n\nNOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implelmentation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy number) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.\n\n\nOriginal Reason for Entitlement Code\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nOREC\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nENTLMT_RSN_ORIG\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMaster Beneficiary Summary File\n\n\n\n\nOriginal reason for Medicare entitlement.\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\nCMS obtains this information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) record systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nOLD AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE (OASI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nDISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS (DIB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nESRD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nBOTH DIB AND ESRD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOsteoporosis End-of-Year Flag\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nOSTEOPRS\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMaster Beneficiary Summary File\n\n\n\n\nThis code specifies whether the beneficiary met the chronic condition algorithm criteria within the specified reference period.\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nNeither claims nor coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nClaims met, coverage not met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nClaims not met, coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nClaims and coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOsteoporosis Mid-Year Flag\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nOSTEOPRM\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMaster Beneficiary Summary File\n\n\n\n\nThis code specifies whether the beneficiary met the chronic condition algorithm criteria on July 1 of the specified reference period.\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nCode Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nNeither claims nor coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nClaims met, coverage not met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nClaims not met, coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nClaims and coverage met\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Developmental Delays End-of-Year Indicator - Medicare Only Claims\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nOTHDEL_MEDICARE\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nMaster Beneficiary Summary File\n\n\n\n\nThis variable indicates whether a beneficiary met the condition criteria for other developmental delays as of the end of the calendar year.\n\n\nNOTE: The condition variable requires beneficiaries to satisfy both claims criteria (a minimum number/type of Medicare claims that have the proper diagnosis codes and occurred within a specified time period) and coverage criteria (Medicare FFS Part A and Part B coverage during the entire specified time period).\n\n\nNOTE1: For other developmental delays, beneficiaries must have at least one Medicare inpatient claim or two other non-drug claims of any service type with a related code in any position during the 2-year reference period.

See FI_NUM table of codes for all FI numbers. 52280 -- Mutual of Omaha (until 6/1/2003) 00430 -- Washington/Alaska (until 11/1/2003) 00310 -- North Carolina BC (until 12/1/2003) 00370 -- Rhode Island (until 2/1/2004) 00270 -- New Hampshire/Vermont (until 3/1/2004) 00181 -- Maine/Massachusetts (until 5/1/2004)\n\n\nNOTE2: It has been discovered that this field may be populated with data on claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 (implementation of Claim Line Expansion OPPS/HHPPS). The original understanding of the new revenue center fields was that data would be populated on claims with dates of service 7/00 and forward.

On the RAP, the rate is determined using the case mix weight associated with the HIPPS code, adjusting it for the wage index for the beneficiary's site of service, then multiplying the result by 60% or 50%, depending on whether or not the RAP is for a first episode.\n\n\nOn the final claim, the HIPPS code could change the payment if the therapy threshold is not met, or partial episode payment (PEP) adjustment or a significant change in condition (SCIC) adjustment. In cases of SCICs, there will be more than one \n0023\n revenue center line, each representing the payment made at each case-mix level.\n\n\nNOTE4: For IRF PPS claims (when revenue center code equals \n0024\n), CMS has developed a PRICER to compute the rate based on the HIPPS/CMG (HIPPS code, stored in revenue center HCPCS code field).\n\n\nRevenue Center Reduced Coinsurance Amount\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nShort SAS Name: \nRDCDCOIN\n\n\nLong SAS Name: \nREV_CNTR_RDCD_COINSRNC_AMT\n\n\n\n\nVariable Names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2013\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2011\n\n\n2010\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2008\n\n\n2007\n\n\n2006\n\n\n2005\n\n\n2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\n\n\n2003\n\n\n2002\n\n\n2001\n\n\n2000\n\n\n1999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\nrdcdcoin\n\n\nrdcdcn\n\n\nrdcdcn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContained in\n\n\n\n\nOutpatient RIF\n\n\n\n\nEffective with Version 'I', for all services subject to Outpatient PPS, the amount of coinsurance applicable to the line for a particular service (HCPCS) for which the provider has elected to reduce the coinsurance amount.\n\n\nNOTE1: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer.

The first total charge line adds\nthe revenue center codes above it correctly; the\nproblem exists below the first total charge line\nwhere garbage may be present due to the FI Standard\nSystem not clearing out fields before processing the\nnext claim. We believe the error began with the change-\nover to a different claims processing contractor in\n1/98.\nCORRECTIVE ACTION :\nCWF created an edit to reject mulitple '0001' revenue\ncenter codes, effective 6/28/99.

Limitation DESCRIPTION :\nDESCRIPTION:\nMissing present on admission (POA) indicators on the NCH claims.\nBACKGROUND :\nA problem has been discovered with the Inpatient claims received\nfrom CWF from July 6, 2009 through October 4, 2009. The\nclaims received during this timeperiod have no POA indicators.\nThe problem was a result of a defect in the conversion code\nused by CWF to convert the new 5010 record format back to the\n4010 format for the NCH. The reason CWF was converting the\nclaims to the 4010 format was because they implemented the 5010\nformat beginning in July 2009 but the NCH is still using\nthe 4010 until \u2153/2011.\nCORRECTIVE ACTION:\nCWF will be sending in adjustment claims to correct the\nproblem. The claims will come into the NCH the week of\nDecember 19, 2009. There were approximately 3 million\nclaims missing the POA indicator.CLM_POA_IND_CD_LIM",

BACKGROUND :\nDuring the NCH Version 'I' conversion, history was populated with an NCH Claim Type Code that will identify the record as an inpatient encounter claim.\nWhen applying the CWF logic to identify an inpatient encounter claim, it was discovered that when all the criteria was met the MCO paid switch was sometimes a blank or '0' (reflecting that the MCO did not pay the provider). CORRECTIVE ACTION :\nWith the inception of the Version 'I' processing (7/00), if all the criteria for identifying an inpatient encounter claim is met but the MCO paid switch is a blank or '0' it is changed to a '1'. A patch code = '13' was applied to all claims back to 7/1/97 service year thru date.",

Limitation DESCRIPTION :\nMEDPAR Admission Death Day Count calculated incorrectly, on both the 3/00 and 6/00 MEDPAR updates.\nBACKGROUND :\nBoth the 3/00 and 6/00 MEDPAR updates incorrectly calculated the mortality days; i.e., days between the admission date and the beneficiary date of death. Users of the regular unencrypted MEDPAR file, this is not a problem, as the count can be calculated using the admission date and the date of death.  The problem is with the encrypted file (the expanded modified MEDPAR) because the fields needed to calculate the mortality days are ranged.\nCORRECTIVE ACTION :\nThe problem was corrected with the 12/00 MEDPAR update.  NOTE:  For users of the expanded modified MEDPAR file who needs the mortality days, the 12/00 update of the FY1999 file can be given as a replacement.\nSOURCE:\nCONTACT :  OIS/EDG/DMUDD",

My modified script used generated data as well as real Medicare data. The Medicare data it used was the first 10% of the rows of the 2011 1% outpatient claims dataset. I.e. \n/disk/aging/medicare/data/01pct/op/2011/opc2011.dta\n. The entire script is shown at the \nbottom\n of this page.\n\n\nStata (\n.dta\n)\n\u00b6\n\n\nDecently fast for Stata to read by column but very slow to read by row for big files, since the Stata reader must scan the entire file before importing the first row.\n\n\nPython can also read Stata files, but it's not the fastest file format to read. The following python code reads the first 10% of the rows of the 2011 1% outpatient claims dataset. This is the data sample that the rest of the benchmarks use.\n\n\npath\n \n=\n \n'/disk/aging/medicare/data/01pct/op/2011/opc2011.dta'\n\n\nitr\n \n=\n \npd\n.\nread_stata\n(\npath\n,\n \niterator\n \n=\n \nTrue\n)\n\n\n%\ntime\n df = itr.get_chunk(int(itr.nobs / 10))\n\n# CPU times: user 17 s, sys: 7.5 s, total: 24.5 s\n\n\n# Wall time: 27 s\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSV (\n.csv\n)\n\u00b6\n\n\nStored as text; Doesn't hold metadata about columns, therefore rather costly CPU-wise to import the data (though still better than reading \n.dta\n files). Python can read in a subset of the columns of a \n.csv\n and can loop over rows without reading in all rows at a time.\n\n\n%\ntimeit\n test_csv_read()\n\n# 2.54 s \u00b1 50.6 ms per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON (\n.json\n)\n\u00b6\n\n\nAlso stored as text; meant for hierarchical data. Overkill for a rectangular data frame.\n\n\nFeather format (\n.feather\n)\n\u00b6\n\n\nVery fast file format to read and write. It's possible to import a subset of columns, but \nnot\n a subset of rows. You must read in all rows of a column at once. It's possible to read \n.feather\n files from R, Python, and Julia.\n\n\n%\ntimeit\n test_feather_read()\n\n# 583 ms \u00b1 10.1 ms per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParquet format (\n.parquet\n)\n\u00b6\n\n\nParquet is similar to the feather format with a few differences. It's a columnar format, like Feather, which means that the data in a matrix/DataFrame is stored in each column, not in each row. That means that a column's data must be kept together. Importantly, however, Parquet files can be split into \nrow groups\n. That means that you can write a certain number of rows in each column at a time. Say the size of your row group is 1,000,000 rows. Then you write the first 1,000,000 rows of all columns, then the next 1,000,000, and so on. This makes it fast to read 1,000,000 at a time of whatever subset (or all) of the columns you want. But you can't read the first 10 rows or the first 100; it must be the size of the row group.\n\n\n%\ntimeit\n test_parquet_read_compress()\n\n# 1.48 s \u00b1 20.2 ms per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\n\n\n\n%\ntimeit\n test_parquet_read()\n\n# 1.47 s \u00b1 22.2 ms per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nls -lh\n-rw-r--r-- \n1\n barronk dua18266  12M Jan  \n9\n \n16\n:31 test_compress.parquet\n-rw-r--r-- \n1\n barronk dua18266  17M Jan  \n9\n \n16\n:32 test.parquet\n-rw-rw-r-- \n1\n barronk dua18266  63M Jan  \n9\n \n16\n:27 test.csv\n\n\n\n\n\nPickle (\n.pkl\n)\n\u00b6\n\n\nPickle is a Python specific format. To my knowledge, it saves objects in disk the same way they're stored in memory by Python. This makes it very fast. However you must read in the entire object; it's impossible to choose a subset of rows or columns.\n\n\n%\ntimeit\n test_pickle_read()\n\n# 1.25 s \u00b1 47.2 ms per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\n\n\n\n%\ntimeit\n test_pickle_read_compress()\n\n# 2.58 s \u00b1 669 ms per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDF5 (\n.hdf\n)\n\u00b6\n\n\nHDF5 is a high performance format that could work for this use case, but I don't really understand it well.

Currently they're usually stored as strings, because any digit with a leading zero upon import isn't considered an integer. Then you have to reference them as strings and you have to look up the lookup table in ResDAC every time you want to do something with them.\n\n\n\n\nConvert them to categoricals. Could improve memory usage and performance by being able to represent these columns as integers, rather than strings.\n\n\nHowever then you wouldn't be able to reference categoricals by the numbers listed in ResDAC.\n\n\nConsider \nclm_type\n. The codes are small values like \n10\n and \n20\n, while the code values are \nHHA claim\n and \nNon swing bed SNF claim\n. The codes are much easier to type, and existing code could be more easily adapted to use these datasets. Having to refer to \nclm_type\n with\n\ndf['clm_type'] == 'Non swing bed SNF claim'\n\ninstead of with\n\ndf['clm_type'] == 20\n\nwould probably get annoying.\n\n\nI can't keep the integer representation of the categorical the number that ResDAC uses because Python requires that there be no spaces among integers. I.e. if Male is represented with \n1\n, Female would have to be represented with \n2\n, it couldn't be represented with \n3\n, because there would be a gap there. Many columns have gaps, and so Python would have to re-index those keys.\n- Convert columns to categoricals but leave the current string values in the data as the keys. Then you'd still refer to the data with ResDAC's code, but there would be enhanced performance by virtue of using integers instead of strings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Python I/O Benchmark\n\u00b6\n\n\nFirst using generated data, then using real Medicare data.

Then you have to reference them as strings and you have to look up the lookup table in ResDAC every time you want to do something with them.   Convert them to categoricals. Could improve memory usage and performance by being able to represent these columns as integers, rather than strings.  However then you wouldn't be able to reference categoricals by the numbers listed in ResDAC.  Consider  clm_type . The codes are small values like  10  and  20 , while the code values are  HHA claim  and  Non swing bed SNF claim . The codes are much easier to type, and existing code could be more easily adapted to use these datasets. Having to refer to  clm_type  with df['clm_type'] == 'Non swing bed SNF claim' \ninstead of with df['clm_type'] == 20 \nwould probably get annoying.  I can't keep the integer representation of the categorical the number that ResDAC uses because Python requires that there be no spaces among integers. I.e. if Male is represented with  1 , Female would have to be represented with  2 , it couldn't be represented with  3 , because there would be a gap there. Many columns have gaps, and so Python would have to re-index those keys.\n- Convert columns to categoricals but leave the current string values in the data as the keys. Then you'd still refer to the data with ResDAC's code, but there would be enhanced performance by virtue of using integers instead of strings.",

I know this is confusing.\n\n\nThe exception is Carrier (Part B) files.  1998-on files are 20% files.\nEarlier, 5% was the maximum.  From 1991-2000, the 5% files had\n\n05\n, \n20\n, \n45\n, \n70\n, \n95\n in positions 8-9 of \nEHIC\n.  So, the 5%\nCarrier files are just symbolic links to those files in the 20pct directory.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe 1985-1990 files had 00-99 in positions 8-9 of \nEHIC\n; however, \n05\n, \n20\n, \n45\n, \n70\n, \n95\n makes up 14-16% each of of the \nEHIC\ns position 8-9. These appear to be all End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) beneficiaries.\n\n\n\n\nAlso noteworthy about the Carrier files:  In 1998-2000, there are two\nversions, H and I. 1998, 1999, and 2000 \na\n files are version H.  and\n1998-1999 \nb\n, \nc\n, and \nd\n files and 2000 files are version I files.\nMy guess is that at one time, the 5% Version H files were bought.\nAt a later time, it became possible to get 20% files, so the 1998-1999\nb, c, and d files and the 2000 files were bought.  Both H and I are\nneeded to make a 20% sample for 1998 and 1999.  It appears based on sample\nsize that the 2000 files are four-5% draws, and that the 2000 a files\nare only useful for historic reasons.\n\n\n2002-2005 Carrier files are split into four 5% draws f[1-4]\n8\nth\n and 9\nth\n position of \nEHIC\n.\n\n\n\n\nf1 ~20% each in (\n05\n,\n20\n,\n45\n,\n70\n,\n95\n);\n\n\nf2 ~20% each in (\n00\n,\n10\n,\n15\n,\n25\n,\n30\n);\n\n\nf3 ~20% each in (\n35\n,\n40\n,\n50\n,\n55\n,\n60\n);\n\n\nf4 ~20% each in (\n65\n,\n75\n,\n80\n,\n85\n,\n90\n);\n\n\n\n\n2002-2005 Carrier and DME files are split in to claims \nclms\n and line items\n\nlnits\n file.  The files can be merged using  \nEHIC\n and claimindex.\n\n\nThe claims data uses \nBENE_ID\n as an identifier beginning in 2006. \n/disk/agedisk1/medicare/data.NOBACKUP/u/c/100pct/xw\n\nhas a crosswalk between \nBENE_ID\n and \nEHIC\n .\n\n\n/disk/aging/medicare/data/`PCT'pct/bsf/[CCYY]/1/unique_in_both_ids[CCYY].[dta|sas7bdat]\n\n\n\n\n\nhas annual files of \nEHIC\n and \nBENE_ID\n where beneficiaries have unique IDs\nin both the \nEHIC\n and \nBENE_ID\n.\n\n\njroth@nber.org\n  Last updated 2016-06-24",

A   5% file has  05 ,  20 ,  45 ,  70 ,  95  in positions 8-9 of  EHIC .  A   1% file has  45  in positions 8-9 of  EHIC .  A 0.1% file has  1545  in positions 6-9 of  EHIC .   From 2006-present:   The   20% and 5% files are consistent but are now identified by the CMS contractor.  The   1% file has  DD  in the 14 th  and 15 th  position of  BENE_ID .  The 0.1% file has  DDDD  in the 12 th -15 th  position of  BENE_ID .   Note that since we have \"only\" a 20% Carrier, the \"1%\" file is actually a 0.2% for 2006-present.\nSimilarly, the \"0.1%\" actually has (0.1*.2)% or 0.002% of all medicare Carrier beneficiaries.  There is a break in the 1% and smaller sample from 2005 to 2006; however,\nsince these files are mostly used for testing, it should be okay.  I know this is confusing.  The exception is Carrier (Part B) files.  1998-on files are 20% files.\nEarlier, 5% was the maximum.  From 1991-2000, the 5% files had 05 ,  20 ,  45 ,  70 ,  95  in positions 8-9 of  EHIC .  So, the 5%\nCarrier files are just symbolic links to those files in the 20pct directory.   Note  The 1985-1990 files had 00-99 in positions 8-9 of  EHIC ; however,  05 ,  20 ,  45 ,  70 ,  95  makes up 14-16% each of of the  EHIC s position 8-9. These appear to be all End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) beneficiaries.   Also noteworthy about the Carrier files:  In 1998-2000, there are two\nversions, H and I. 1998, 1999, and 2000  a  files are version H.  and\n1998-1999  b ,  c , and  d  files and 2000 files are version I files.\nMy guess is that at one time, the 5% Version H files were bought.\nAt a later time, it became possible to get 20% files, so the 1998-1999\nb, c, and d files and the 2000 files were bought.  Both H and I are\nneeded to make a 20% sample for 1998 and 1999.  It appears based on sample\nsize that the 2000 files are four-5% draws, and that the 2000 a files\nare only useful for historic reasons.  2002-2005 Carrier files are split into four 5% draws f[1-4]\n8 th  and 9 th  position of  EHIC .   f1 ~20% each in ( 05 , 20 , 45 , 70 , 95 );  f2 ~20% each in ( 00 , 10 , 15 , 25 , 30 );  f3 ~20% each in ( 35 , 40 , 50 , 55 , 60 );  f4 ~20% each in ( 65 , 75 , 80 , 85 , 90 );   2002-2005 Carrier and DME files are split in to claims  clms  and line items lnits  file.  The files can be merged using   EHIC  and claimindex.  The claims data uses  BENE_ID  as an identifier beginning in 2006.  /disk/agedisk1/medicare/data.NOBACKUP/u/c/100pct/xw \nhas a crosswalk between  BENE_ID  and  EHIC  .  /disk/aging/medicare/data/`PCT'pct/bsf/[CCYY]/1/unique_in_both_ids[CCYY].[dta|sas7bdat]  has annual files of  EHIC  and  BENE_ID  where beneficiaries have unique IDs\nin both the  EHIC  and  BENE_ID .  jroth@nber.org   Last updated 2016-06-24",

Now that the program is set up, we aim to generate an HMO indicator\nand a buy-in indicator based on the values specified in the table above.   If the index event occurred before the start date or after the end date, set both HMO and buy-in indicators to  0 .  If the index event occurred within the window of time to check, then loop from  [relative event month - months before]  through  [relative event month + months after]  and check whether the HMO and buy-in indicators for those months.

We can't count all of it because some of it occurred after\nthe event and some after. In this case we count\n\n\n\n\nFor lag, take the charges during the admission and multiply by the\n  portion of the admission that occurred from the admission until the event.\n\n\nFor the post, take the charges during the admission and multiply by the\n  portion of the admission that occurred from the event until discharge.\n\n\n\n\nWe apply a similar rule admissions pre and post:\n\n\n    A\n  |----|\n  [-------------)\n        |---------------|\n        |       x       |\n        |---------------|\n                (-------------]\n                          |---------|\n                               B\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could count all charges in A, as they occurred completely within the 30-day\nwindow before the event.
